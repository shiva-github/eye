He works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. <br><br>He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans,” and his contributions demonstrates this through his WordPress translation work and multi-lingual support projects for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7023\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?w=1728&amp;ssl=1 1728w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Bhutanese contributors to the Dzongkha locale on WordPress Translation Day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2016, Ugyen was looking for a new job after his former cloud company ran into financial difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview he was asked many questions about WordPress and, although he had a basic understanding of WordPress, he struggled to give detailed answers. After that interview he resolved to develop his skills and learn as much about WordPress as he could.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months passed and he received a call from ServMask Inc, who had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration. They offered him a position, fulfilling his wish to work with WordPress full-time. And because of that, Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp Bangkok 2018</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was a turning point event for Ugyen. WordCamps are a great opportunity to meet WordPress community members you don’t otherwise get to know, and he was able to attend his first WordCamp through the sponsorship of his company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first day of WordCamp Bangkok was a Contributor Day, where people volunteer to work together to contribute to the development of WordPress. Ugyen joined the Community team to have conversations with WordPress users from all over the world. He was able to share his ideas for supporting new speakers, events and organizers to help build the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the main day of the event, Ugyen managed a photo booth for speakers, organizers, and attendees to capture their memories of WordCamp.&nbsp;He also got to take some time out to attend several presentations during the conference. What particularly stuck in Ugyen’s mind was learning that having a website content plan has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Co-Organizing<strong> Thimphu</strong>&#8216;s <strong>WordPress Meetup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After attending WordCamp Bangkok 2018 as well as a local Meetup event, Ugyen decided to&nbsp;introduce WordPress to his home country and cities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the WordPress Translation Day organizers, he realized that his local language, Dzongkha, was not as fully translated as other languages in the WordPress Core Translation. That is when Ugyen knew that he wanted to help build his local community. He organized Thimphu’s first WordPress Meetup to coincide with WordPress Translation Day 4, and it was a huge success!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all WordPress Meetups, the Thimpu WordPress Meetup is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup which covers everything related to WordPress. But it also keeps in mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness\">Bhutanese Gross National Happiness</a> four pillars by aiming to preserve and promote their unique culture and national language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Big dreams get accomplished one step at a time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugyen has taken an active role in preserving his national language by encouraging his community to use WordPress, including Dzongkha bloggers, online Dzongkha news outlets, and government websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while Ugyen has only been actively involved in the community for a short period, he has contributed much to the WordPress community, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>becoming a Translation Contributor for WordPress Core Translation for Dzongkha;</li><li>participating in the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day 4</a> Livestream and organizing team;</li><li>inviting WordPress Meetup Thimphu members and WordPress experts from other countries to join the <a href=\"https://wpbhutan.slack.com/\">local Slack instance</a>;</li><li>encouraging ServMask Inc. to become an event sponsor;</li><li>providing the Dzongkha Development Commission the opportunity to involve their language experts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to WordPress, Ugyen particularly focuses on encouraging local and international language WordPress bloggers;&nbsp;helping startups succeed with WordPress;&nbsp;and sharing what he has learned from WordPress with his Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor, Ugyen hopes to accomplish even more for the Bhutan and Asian WordPress Communities. His dreams for his local community are big, including teaching more people about open source, hosting a local WordCamp, and helping to organize WordCamp Asia in 2020 &#8212; all while raising awareness of his community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo-1.jpg?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7026\" width=\"110\" height=\"83\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

This is a feature that has traditionally been handled by plugins, which has resulted in many different implementations across different sites. It also means that many sites do not have XML sitemaps, which can be a problem because they are hugely important to having your site correctly indexed by search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal details how core sitemaps would be structured and how the team would build them, as well as what aspects of WordPress would not be considered appropriate information to be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building this feature? Comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/12/xml-sitemaps-feature-project-proposal/\">the proposal</a>, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>, and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Translation Milestone for the Spanish Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_es/status/1138015568563441665\">The WordPress community of Spain has worked hard</a> to make <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es/\">the es_ES locale</a> the first in the world to fully localize all of WordPress Core along with all Meta projects, apps, and the top 200 plugins. This is made possible by having the largest translation team out of any locale, consisting of 2,951 individual contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in translating WordPress into our locale?

E2e testing, which has been successfully used by Gutenberg, is used to simulate real user scenarios and validate process flows. Currently, the setup requires <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/install/\">Docker</a> to run, and a number of e2e test utilities are already available in the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/e2e-test-utils/src\">@wordpress/e2e-test-utils</a> package, in the Gutenberg repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to use this feature?

Two new packages have been created that require code review and testing. The first is an Autoload Package, a foundational package for theme developers who are not currently using Composer (although <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended instead of this package). The second is a Customizer Section Button Package that allows theme authors to create a link/button to any URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other proposed ideas for packages that require feedback and additional discussion.

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Kids events focus on teaching children how to become content creators, creative thinkers, and even business owners. Numerous repeat attendees have morphed their personal blogs into businesses and these kids are only 8-13 years old. Kids events provide an opportunity for local communities to foster long term community growth. These events also offer opportunities for a more diverse event in that kids bring a new perspective to any event. WordPress and its surrounding communities have the opportunity to change the lives of kids all over the world.</p>\n<h2>History of Kids Events</h2>\n<p>The history of Kids Events is full of many Heroes who have worked tirelessly to ensure that children in our community are included in events. Most of these events happen in tandem with WordCamps, but that is not always the case. Here is the history of most of the Kids Events and the Heroes behind them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2010-03-06 &#8211; Kilkenny, Ireland &#8211; Sabrina Dent<a href=\"https://www.krishna.me/wordcamp-ireland-in-kilkenny-has-its-own-kids-camp/\"> https://www.krishna.me/wordcamp-ireland-in-kilkenny-has-its-own-kids-camp/</a></li>\n<li>2011-01-29 &#8211; Phoenix, AZ &#8211; Abbie Sanderson<a href=\"https://2015.dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/07/06/announcing-wordcamp-for-kids/\"> https://2015.dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/07/06/announcing-wordcamp-for-kids/</a></li>\n<li>2013-01-20 &#8211; Phoenix &#8211; Natalie MacLees<a href=\"https://2013.phoenix.wordcamp.org/schedule/sunday/\"> https://2013.phoenix.wordcamp.org/schedule/sunday/</a></li>\n<li>2013-04-06 &#8211; Miami</li>\n<li>2014-05-11 &#8211; Miami &#8211; Tammy Lister and Sarah Gooding <a href=\"https://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop/\"> https://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop/</a></li>\n<li>2014-01-19 &#8211; Phoenix &#8211; Bernice Lee and Andy Christian<a href=\"https://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/wordcamp-kids/\"> https://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/wordcamp-kids/</a></li>\n<li>2014-03-15 &#8211; Atlanta &#8211; Syed Balkhi, Sara Cannon, Micah Wood, and Russell Fair <a href=\"https://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/kidscamp-atlanta/\"> https://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/kidscamp-atlanta/</a></li>\n<li>2015-03-15 &#8211; St Louis &#8211; Russell Fair, Chris Koerner, Lucas Lima, Eric Juden, Michele Butcher-Jones <a href=\"https://2015.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/kids-camp/\">https://2015.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/kids-camp/</a></li>\n<li>2015-03-27 &#8211; Atlanta, GA &#8211; Russell Fair<a href=\"https://2015.atlanta.wordcamp.org/\"> https://2015.atlanta.wordcamp.org/</a></li>\n<li>2015-05-31 &#8211; Miami FL Nikhil V, Sarrah Vesselov, Shawn Hooper and Michele Butcher-Jones. <a href=\"https://2015.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-for-kids-tickets-now-available/\">https://2015.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-for-kids-tickets-now-available/</a></li>\n<li>2016-02-20 &#8211; Miami, FL &#8211; Sandy Edwards, Kimberly Lipari, Michele Butcher-Jones, Shawn Hooper,  and Chris Christoff https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/2016/02/05/details-on-weekend-kids-activities/#workshop</li>\n<li>2016-09-26 &#8211; Dallas/Ft.

The programs offer events, workshops, and inclusion in the ever-growing WordPress community.</p>\n<p>The community as a whole has always provided educational and networking events to further personal development. Kids Programming is no different.</p>\n<p>Events focus on key skill sets such as public speaking, writing, networking, and communication. Children get to work with peers in exciting and fulfilling ways and leave the events with new friends. These friends often live in various places around the globe and create the opportunity for long-distance friendships fostered through technological resources.</p>\n<p>For example, my son lives in Orlando and has friends in Tampa, Jacksonville and even out of state. He keeps in touch through Facebook Messenger or Slack.</p>\n<p>The fact is our kids need a fun way to use real-world skills in a non-threatening environment. A place where they won’t be tested and where they can’t fail.</p>\n<p>These programs offer just that. With over 40 different volunteers helping to foster this program across the globe it is becoming a WordPress community staple.</p>\n<p>There is still much to do. Safety has to be our #1 priority when working with minors and that means keeping things pretty consistent. There is a group of amazing volunteers documenting the process of planning a kids event and class curriculum.</p>\n<p>The team is working on checklists and curriculum to make it super easy for a meetup chapter or WordCamp to add a kids event or kids program to their offering.</p>\n<p>The future for these programs is looking very bright. There is ever-growing interested in events, and more people wanting to be part of the kids&#8217; event revolution.</p>\n<p>You too can be a hero. We need more people to write, edit, translate and test these programs. No experience is necessary and you don’t have to love kids either. This initiative allows so many children from different backgrounds and walks of life to be included in a super caring community. We see kids whose parents are already in the community and also kids who otherwise would never know the community exists. Your time is going to help create the next generation of WordPress!

Newspack is a collection of themes, plugins, and features geared towards newsrooms such as revenue generation wizards, mobile delivery, and search engine optimization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Beatty, head of Newspack Communication says they&#8217;re seeking up to 50 newsrooms to be part of phase two which lasts from September 1st &#8211; February 29th, 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What you’ll get: a new Newspack website, including the migration of your existing site; free hosting, security, updates, backups and support on WordPress.com through February 2020; membership in the Newspack community of users; access to Newspack developers; exclusive performance benchmarking against your peers; and more,&#8221; Beatty said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations that are selected are expected to provide feedback, test new features, and help shape the overall direction of the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free hosting for charter members will expire on February 29th, 2020. News organizations with revenue under $500K can expect to pay $1,000 per month and organizations that generate revenue of over $500K will pay $2,000 per month. Newspack is currently in negotiations to provide subsidies for organizations that encounter difficulties with the pricing structure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested in participating in the charter program have until August 15th to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPF-XEbRDoOmSyGBYCyQZgleFcXNNnJExZCd9bsjw93jAXRg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1\">fill out the application</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 20:36:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 28\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91699&preview=true&preview_id=91699\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-28\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7685:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn’t make it into a full post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changes to WordPress PHP Coding Standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on changes that were <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">proposed back in March</a>, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/\">PHP Coding Standards</a> for WordPress have been altered. Note that these changes apply to WordPress core only and Gary Pendergast recommends that developers can and should choose practices that best suit your needs for plugins and themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/07/12/php-coding-standards-changes/\">PHP Coding Standards Changes</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Excluding Remote Employee Job Applicants Based on the State They Live In</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Brad, the topic of not hiring job applicants for a remote company based on the state they live in because of tax laws is not something I&#8217;ve seen discussed. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A really interesting topic around remote companies, and one I haven\'t seen talked about much, is the idea of \"stateism\". Basically, not hiring from certain states because of their heavy handed laws (usually tax related). There are a few states I\'d rather avoid at this point.</p>&mdash; Brad Williams (@williamsba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba/status/1149727445450481664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain situations, companies that go the extra mile to hire a remote worker can also turn that person into an advocate. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Interesting. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpengine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wpengine</a> had to jump through some additional hoops to employ me remotely as a Canadian and I think that shows what a good employer they are and makes me advocate for them more. Worth thinking about beyond purely financial considerations.</p>&mdash; Chris Garrett (@chrisgarrett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgarrett/status/1149729535782318081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re involved in the hiring process for a remote company, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this topic in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Would You Like to See A Product Hunt for WordPress Products?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you create something awesome in the WordPress ecosystem, it&#8217;s tough to get the word out. Ben from LyrWP wants to know if anyone is interested in a <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a> website for Themes, Plugins, and Services. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would anyone be interested in a Producthunt purely for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> themes, plugins and services? I think this needs doing. It\'s hard for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/developers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#developers</a> to get the products they slave over out there without costing a bomb in marketing. Anybody else interested in this happening?</p>&mdash; Ben (@lyrwp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyrwp/status/1149693535949590529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a great idea and something I&#8217;d like to see become a reality. There are probably a ton of great products in the WordPress space that go unseen because there&#8217;s no easy way to reach a large mass of people outside of sites like the Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mario Peshev is concerned that such a site may end up posting infrequently or promote mediocre products. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don\'t disagree with your stance. I just think that the overall quality of WP-baked solutions is pretty poor.<br /><br />Meaning that the site will end up promoting mediocre products or post infrequently, that\'s all.</p>&mdash; Mario Peshev (@no_fear_inc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/no_fear_inc/status/1149746943389814784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If Peshev&#8217;s concern became a reality, there wouldn&#8217;t be much of a point to continue with the site and developers would be back to square one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of learning about new products, who remembers the <a href=\"https://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2013/01/16/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-116-3/\">Plugin Release posts</a> on WeblogToolsCollection.com?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Early Look at What A Block Directory in WP-Admin Could Look Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mel Choyce has shared a collection of concept images that depict what a Block Directory could look like inside of WP-Admin. She describes the inspiration for each image and how each screen would work. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/07/11/block-directory-in-wp-admin-concepts/\">Block Directory in WP-Admin Concepts</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>What I find interesting is that users will be able to try out new blocks before installing them. &#8220;Inside the modal, you’d also be able to demo a block before installing. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ck3lee/\">@ck3lee</a> has figured out how to make this possible,&#8221; Choyce said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also great to see that the tech behind <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/shiny-updates-in-4-6/\">Shiny Updates</a> will be used for quickly installing and activating new blocks. If you have feedback regarding the conceptual designs, please leave a comment on her post. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes From Lead Developer Conference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 Automatticians are attending the <a href=\"https://london2019.theleaddeveloper.com/\">Lead Developer Conference</a> in London, England, and are publishing notes from each day. You can check out <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/lead-developer-conference-day-one/\">Day 1 here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WPCampus 2019 Will Be LiveStreamed </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpcampusorg/status/1149446903257604100\">Thanks to Pantheon</a>, all sessions excluding workshops at WPCampus will be livestreamed with captioning and available to watch for free. Simply visit the <a href=\"https://2019.wpcampus.org/watch/\">livestream page</a> on Friday, July 26 and Saturday, July 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apply for a DonateWC WordCamp Sponsorship</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DonateWC is <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/sponsorship-application-form/\">looking for applicants</a> for its sponsorship program. DonateWC provides underrepresented and minority groups within the WordPress community with the means to attend a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for issue twenty-eight.

Inspired by a conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a> at WordCamp Europe, Arntz created the plugin to &#8220;explore what the theming of tomorrow could look like already today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block Areas allows users to define specific areas where they want to use the block editor (outside of regular posts). The block areas function similar to widget areas, but are created using a custom post type with a familiar admin UI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/block-areas-admin-page.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;They are implemented as a post type – with the key aspect that they can’t be accessed in the frontend via a certain URL, but your theme has to render them via a block_areas()->render( $slug ) method that the plugin exposes,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;The slug you pass to the method should match the block area slug (i.e. post slug) of one of the areas you have created in the admin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin comes with block areas for site header and footer to provide a starting point. However, adding the block areas to a theme is one technical hurdle that currently limits this experimental plugin to developers.</p>\n<p>The concept is reminiscent of the now seemingly abandoned <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buckets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Buckets</a> plugin that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buckets-a-wordpress-widgets-alternative-for-placing-content-anywhere\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aimed to provide an alternative to WordPress widgets</a>. It allows admins to create reusable pieces of content and place them anywhere on their sites. Reusable buckets can be created with the same UI as the legacy post editor and then placed anywhere using a shortcode or via a button in the TinyMCE editor.</p>\n<p>In the case of Buckets, the idea was to preserve the users&#8217; ability to create content using the visual editor and media manager. Block Areas seems to have a similar aim &#8211; to preserve users&#8217; ability to use the block editor anywhere they want throughout the site. That is part of the general goal of Gutenberg Phase 2, which includes migrating widgets and menus to use the block editor.</p>\n<p>Block Areas is just one idea for providing a unified approach to reusable content inside WordPress. It is not an official project and may not be the approach that the Gutenberg team settles on for core. However, it offers a good opportunity for discussion and collaboration about the possibilities of taking the editor sitewide. This will open up a whole new genre of blocks for plugin developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Think about a block that renders the site title, the custom header, a menu, the copyright information – taking Gutenberg to the site level opens up a whole new set of typical blocks that would be required,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;Start thinking about which blocks you would need outside of your post content bubble today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/block-areas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Areas</a> plugin is available on GitHub if you want to experiment with it.

This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Ugyen Dorji from Bhutan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugyen lives in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan\">Bhutan</a>, a landlocked country situated between two giant neighbors, India to the south and China to the north. He works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. <br /><br />He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans,” and his contributions demonstrates this through his WordPress translation work and multi-lingual support projects for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?fit=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7023\" />Bhutanese contributors to the Dzongkha locale on WordPress Translation Day\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2016, Ugyen was looking for a new job after his former cloud company ran into financial difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview he was asked many questions about WordPress and, although he had a basic understanding of WordPress, he struggled to give detailed answers. After that interview he resolved to develop his skills and learn as much about WordPress as he could.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months passed and he received a call from ServMask Inc, who had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration. They offered him a position, fulfilling his wish to work with WordPress full-time. And because of that, Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp Bangkok 2018</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was a turning point event for Ugyen. WordCamps are a great opportunity to meet WordPress community members you don’t otherwise get to know, and he was able to attend his first WordCamp through the sponsorship of his company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first day of WordCamp Bangkok was a Contributor Day, where people volunteer to work together to contribute to the development of WordPress. Ugyen joined the Community team to have conversations with WordPress users from all over the world. He was able to share his ideas for supporting new speakers, events and organizers to help build the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the main day of the event, Ugyen managed a photo booth for speakers, organizers, and attendees to capture their memories of WordCamp.&nbsp;He also got to take some time out to attend several presentations during the conference. What particularly stuck in Ugyen’s mind was learning that having a website content plan has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Co-Organizing<strong> Thimphu</strong>&#8216;s <strong>WordPress Meetup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After attending WordCamp Bangkok 2018 as well as a local Meetup event, Ugyen decided to&nbsp;introduce WordPress to his home country and cities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the WordPress Translation Day organizers, he realized that his local language, Dzongkha, was not as fully translated as other languages in the WordPress Core Translation. That is when Ugyen knew that he wanted to help build his local community. He organized Thimphu’s first WordPress Meetup to coincide with WordPress Translation Day 4, and it was a huge success!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all WordPress Meetups, the Thimpu WordPress Meetup is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup which covers everything related to WordPress. But it also keeps in mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness\">Bhutanese Gross National Happiness</a> four pillars by aiming to preserve and promote their unique culture and national language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Big dreams get accomplished one step at a time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugyen has taken an active role in preserving his national language by encouraging his community to use WordPress, including Dzongkha bloggers, online Dzongkha news outlets, and government websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while Ugyen has only been actively involved in the community for a short period, he has contributed much to the WordPress community, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>becoming a Translation Contributor for WordPress Core Translation for Dzongkha;</li><li>participating in the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day 4</a> Livestream and organizing team;</li><li>inviting WordPress Meetup Thimphu members and WordPress experts from other countries to join the <a href=\"https://wpbhutan.slack.com/\">local Slack instance</a>;</li><li>encouraging ServMask Inc. to become an event sponsor;</li><li>providing the Dzongkha Development Commission the opportunity to involve their language experts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to WordPress, Ugyen particularly focuses on encouraging local and international language WordPress bloggers;&nbsp;helping startups succeed with WordPress;&nbsp;and sharing what he has learned from WordPress with his Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor, Ugyen hopes to accomplish even more for the Bhutan and Asian WordPress Communities. His dreams for his local community are big, including teaching more people about open source, hosting a local WordCamp, and helping to organize WordCamp Asia in 2020 &#8212; all while raising awareness of his community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo-1.jpg?fit=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7026\" width=\"110\" height=\"83\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

Serious problems seem to generate unhelpfully broad and exaggerated headlines, like Alexis Madrigal at <em>The Atlantic </em>describing &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">the coalition out to kill tech as we know it</a>.&#8221; He provides a good breakdown of the many interest groups and the perspectives in play, however, from Antitrust Theorists to Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\">surveillance capitalism</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Writer and Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler says the internet is becoming a &#8220;dark forest&#8221; as people retreat to &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Madrigal is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/facebook-and-youtubes-platform-excuse-dying/591466/\">probably right</a> that people are tired of hearing that publishing platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have no role in policing &#8220;provably false information&#8221; posted by their users. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/free-speech-privacy-and-web/\">Brian predicted this</a> several years ago before WordPress.com <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/new-wordpress-policy-allows-it-to-shut-down-blogs-of-sandy-hook-deniers/\">came under pressure</a> to shut down sites denying the Sandy Hook school shooting ever happened. Now the boundaries of acceptable content are more actively guarded but not consistently or well, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">in some cases like Facebook</a> or YouTube, if the cure is human moderation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">it&#8217;s as bad as the disease</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Google product manager and <a href=\"https://humanetech.com/\">Center for Humane Technology</a> founder Tristan Harris is near the top of Madrigal&#8217;s list of tech-killers. Harris <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-how-youre-being-manipulated-1835853810\">recently testified</a> before the US Senate with <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/6/optimizing-for-engagement-understanding-the-use-of-persuasive-technology-on-internet-platforms\">such stark examples of manipulative interfaces</a> that one senator said he was thankful he would &#8220;be dead and gone &#8230; when  all this shit comes to fruition.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Harris is good at generating outrage by publicizing truly outrageous things Google, Facebook, and others are doing, it&#8217;s not always clear what he thinks should be done. Does protecting our attention, or children&#8217;s developing brains, or democracy itself require platforms to police themselves or be policed by someone else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to Harris, Pinboard owner and widely read blogger Maciej Ceglowski made a less dramatic but similarly urgent <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ceglowski%20Testimony%205-7-19.pdf\">statement</a> about privacy and data collection to the Senate back in May. (<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm\">Web version and video link</a>.) A more recent post on Ceglowski&#8217;s blog called &#8220;<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm\">The New Wilderness</a>&#8221; argues we need laws protecting the digital environment from surveillance, so it retains a &#8220;wilderness&#8221; of &#8220;ambient privacy.&#8221; Like Harris, Ceglowski focuses on Facebook and Google as &#8220;the world’s most sophisticated dragnet surveillance operation, a duopoly that rakes in nearly two-thirds of the money spent on online ads.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with Ceglowski&#8217;s imagery, writer and Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler says <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">the internet is becoming a &#8220;dark forest&#8221;</a> as people retreat to &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strickler isn&#8217;t talking about &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces on the web that offer unmoderated, possibly objectionable content; he means areas without algorithms that keep <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/unpopular-content-schwartz\">&#8220;unpopular&#8221; material</a> out of our monetized attention:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem Strickler sees with our retreat from the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parts of the internet is the possibility of their discredit and loss.

[<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/planet/feed/#note-1\">1</a>]</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctorow describes the alternative to picking media winners and tech losers <a href=\"https://craphound.com/news/2019/06/24/i-shouldnt-have-to-publish-this-in-the-new-york-times-my-op-ed-from-the-future/\">on his blog</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We can either try to fix Big Tech (by making it use its monopoly profits to clean up its act) or we can fix the internet (by breaking them up and denying them access to monopoly profits) — but we can’t do both.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what Option A (self-regulation) would look like or how it could help, which is partly Doctorow&#8217;s point. If Option B (trust-busting) happens, it would probably leave a lot more space for wild things to grow. But even in the shadow of Big Tech monopolies, WordPress and other mature open source ecosystems still represent their antithesis, like a vast network of old-growth forests connected to small stands of young saplings. That analogy reminds me of <a href=\"https://mor10.com/wordpress-the-15-year-revolution/\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s reflections on WordPress&#8217;s 15th anniversary</a> and his hope that his &#8220;son will be building his own web experiences using software that traces its roots back to [WordPress].&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wild, biodiverse forest image is a good one for us because it is an image of social, interdependent, and very different individuals. Peter Wohlleben&#8217;s book on <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em> could just as easily describe the cooperative, distributive, and passionately interconnected, democratic nature of open source communities at their best:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When trees grow together, nutrients and water can be optimally divided among them all so that each tree can grow into the best tree it can be. If you &#8220;help&#8221; individual trees by getting rid of their supposed competition, the remaining trees are bereft. They send messages out to their neighbors in vain, because nothing remains but stumps. Every tree now muddles along on its own, giving rise to great differences in productivity. Some individuals photosynthesize like mad until sugar positively bubbles along their trunk. As a result, they are fit and grow better, but they aren&#8217;t particularly long-lived. This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it. And there are now a lot of losers in the forest. Weaker members, who would once have been supported by the stronger ones, suddenly fall behind. Whether the reason for their decline is their location and lack of nutrients, a  passing malaise, or genetic makeup, they now fall prey to insects and fungi.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the giants are in trouble if they are the last trees standing. Wohlleben explains they will end up presiding over a barren desert where little more than weeds can survive:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that how evolution works?&#8221; you ask. The survival of the fittest? Their well-being depends on their community, and when the supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well. When that happens, the forest is no longer a single closed unit. Hot sun and swirling winds can now penetrate to the forest floor and disrupt the moist, cool climate. Even strong trees get sick a lot over the course of their lives. When this happens, they depend on their weaker neighbors for support. If they are no longer there, then all it takes is what would once have been a harmless insect attack to seal the fate even of giants.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If we maintain open source communities that are accessible and inclusive  <br /> — for big and small, young and old, established businesses and new ones — then we are doing our part to keep the web wild and healthy. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f3de.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a id=\"note-1\" href=\"https://medium.com/whither-news/news-publishers-go-to-war-with-the-internet-and-we-all-lose-cc8aca5336f5\">Jeff Jarvis thinks that&#8217;s what newspapers want</a> — a &#8220;war with the internet,&#8221; i.e. the major platform providers — out of the hope this might restore their previous command of advertising and attention.

JAMstack is a term coined by <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a> CEO Mathias Biilmann to describe development architecture that includes client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup, the three pillars of a modern static website.</p>\n<p>Static websites are making a major comeback right now, perhaps as a reaction to the slow, bloated PHP frameworks that run large portions of the web today. The speed, security, and scalability of these sites, often available at a lower cost, are some of the most compelling reasons developers find themselves joining the rapidly growing JAMstack community. It also provides a git and CLI-friendly development workflow and allows developers to easily experiment with the latest frontend technologies, without prescribing any specific frameworks or tools.</p>\n<p>Most JAMstack sites are built using Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt, Next, Gatsby, or another <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">static site generator</a>. The generated markup and assets are often served via a CDN for near instant page loads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a> pioneered JAMstack hosting and has inspired the creation of a myriad of tools that enable fast and convenient deployments. Plugins that allow developers source content from WordPress and host it with Netlify are starting to pop up more frequently. Netlify&#8217;s free tier is one of the main reasons it has grown so quickly in popularity, as it provides a fast way to host a personal site or small project with custom domain support, HTTPS, Git integration, and continuous deployment included.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tinypixel.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Pixel Collective</a> created a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/pixelcollective/netlify-deploy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify Deploy</a> that automates Netlify builds on WordPress publish and update events. The company built it to make it easier for developers to rebuild Netlify-hosted Gatsby frontends using WordPress as the publishing tool. It works in the background to keep a static frontend in sync with the post database, rebuilding the site when users make updates to posts and pages. The plugin triggers the Netlify webhook whenever the standard WordPress posttypes post and page undergo a change in publish status, but it can also be modified to work with custom post types and custom publish hooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jamstack-deployments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JAMstack Deployments</a>, created by <a href=\"https://crgeary.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Geary</a>, a developer and JAMstack aficionado, is a similar WordPress plugin that facilitates deployments to Netlify, as well as other platforms. The plugin&#8217;s settings page lets users configure the webhook URL in the admin, and includes options to limit it to trigger on specific post types and taxonomies. JAMstack Deployments is also conveniently available for free on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webhook-netlify-deploy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deploy Netlify Webhook</a> is a similar plugin from <a href=\"https://lukesecomb.digital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Secomb</a> that appears to work manually through a &#8220;Build&#8221; button in the WordPress admin. It has the added benefit of allowing developers to check the status of the latest build to see if it was successful, without having to leave WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/netlify-webhook-deploy.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://justinwhall.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Hall</a>, a plugin author and senior web developer at SendGrid, published his <a href=\"https://github.com/justinwhall/gatsby-wordpress-netlify-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby + Headless WordPress + Netlify starter skeleton</a> to GitHub. This particular setup requires his <a href=\"https://github.com/justinwhall/littlebot-netlify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LittleBot Netlify plugin</a> to trigger Netlify build hooks on post save or update, with an additional option that allows WordPress users to publish to Staging or Production sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stage-production.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP2Static</a> is a popular plugin that generates static HTML files rom a WordPress site. Users have the option of auto-deploying to a folder on the server, a ZIP file, FTP server, S3, GitHub, Netlify, BunnyCDN, BitBucket, or GitLab. Theh plugin currently has more than 10,000 active installations.</p>\n<p>These are just a small sampling of tools that developers are creating to allow WordPress users to retain the capabilities a dynamic publishing platform while building it statically to take advantage of the speed, security, and performance gains.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I used to be afraid I was distracting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> folks by teaching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gatsbyjs</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it\'s clear WordPress devs must learn tools like Gatsby to stay relevant, and WordPress must meet headless needs to stay relevant. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnJavascriptDeeply?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LearnJavascriptDeeply</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetsDoThis?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LetsDoThis</a><a href=\"https://t.co/TEJeNrFa1K\">https://t.co/TEJeNrFa1K</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/69geFKlZ9r\">https://t.co/69geFKlZ9r</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Zac Gordon (@zgordon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zgordon/status/1141392958341746689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 19, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The trend towards using a headless CMS combined with static site generators is a setup that is heavily geared towards developers at the moment. <a href=\"https://bejamas.io/blog/jamstack-for-clients/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Translating all the jargon</a> for non-technical site and business owners is a new challenge for those looking to sell services for setting up JAMstack architecture.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where more user-friendly hosting platforms like <a href=\"https://www.strattic.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Strattic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.getshifter.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shifter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hardypress.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HardyPress</a> are making inroads on marketing JAMstack technology to a less-technical crowd. They provide all-in-one &#8220;serverless&#8221; architecture solutions that generate static files from WordPress sites and serve them via CDN.</p>\n<p>One of the chief drawbacks to pursuing a static WordPress setup is that many dynamic capabilities do not work in this environment. Adding contact forms can be a challenge. Sites that require native WordPress comments or anything that is more complex and interactive will not work. This includes functionality offered by WooCommerce, bbPress, BuddyPress, and membership plugins, to name a few examples. For now, the JAMstack fervor is mostly limited to the DIY developer crowd looking to host more simple sites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 03:02:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Seeks to Curb Obtrusive Admin Notices with New Requirement to Follow Core Design Patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91604\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-to-curb-obtrusive-admin-notices-with-new-requirement-to-follow-core-design-patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3856:\"<p>For years, the WordPress admin has become increasingly overloaded with admin notices.

In the excitement of yesterday&#8217;s announcement about the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-initiates-new-long-term-plan-to-make-all-wordpress-org-themes-accessible\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">long-term plan to make make all WordPress.org themes accessible,</a> this small bit of good news regarding admin notices slipped through the cracks. The team ratified a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1562696178471900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> from TRT member Danny Cooper to require all themes to use WordPress&#8217; admin_notices API.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All the notifications generated by a theme should use the admin_notices API and follow the core design pattern.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this week&#8217;s the meeting, Cooper cited Storefront, WooCommerce&#8217;s flagship theme, as one example of a theme-generated notice that does not follow the core design pattern and is shown on every page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/storefront-notice.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Another example is this style of activation notice on the Noto theme from Pixelgrade:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pixelgrade.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Futurio theme has also employed a similar style notice for getting started after activation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/futurio.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the past these notices have not been expressly forbidden, although they are generally frowned upon by those who want to keep the WordPress admin from being overtaken by large, branded notices and calls to action.</p>\n<p>Another example of an obtrusive notice is Hestia&#8217;s popup that appears if you activate the theme but then navigate to &#8220;Add New&#8221; on the Themes screen to hunt for a different theme.

This release brings in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-team-is-exploring-adding-motion-to-block-moving-actions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">animation experiments</a> that Matías Ventura introduced in a post titled “<a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/using-motion-to-express-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Using Motion to Express Change</a>.&#8221; The subtle animations add realistic motion to block changes, creation, removal, and reordering, creating a smoother transition between actions. It lends a bit of sophistication to what was previously an instant but more abrupt interaction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Riad Benguella&#8217;s demo video shows the new animation for block reordering. When blocks are added or deleted, content moves around the screen more fluidly, with the surrounding blocks sliding into place. You can test it live and see it in action on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Playground</a>, which is now hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>\n<p>Version 6.1 also incorporates more experiments on the block-based widgets screen that is still in progress. A new widget blocks editor has been added to the Customizer under a panel labeled &#8220;Widget Blocks (Experimental).&#8221; At the moment, editing widgets in the Customizer in such a constricted space doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense. It&#8217;s easy to get the controls jumbled up on top of each other. Live previews work but are much slower than the experience of using the post editor, and users may wonder why they can&#8217;t simply edit the content on the page where it appears. It&#8217;s important to remember that this is still an experiment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.27.28-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The experimental widgets screen has also been updated to include the block inspector and a global inserter.

These include some of the items that are required for theme authors who want to add the accessibility-ready tag. A handful of these requirements will soon be added to the standard requirements for all themes. The initial focus will be on items that do not have a major visible impact on a theme&#8217;s design, as the team anticipates some pushback from designers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve long made the argument that WCAG can&#8217;t easily be applied to a theme which has no content; I don&#8217;t think we want to break that,&#8221; Accessibility team member Joe Dolson said. &#8220;For the purpose of theme testing, I think it&#8217;s still better to target a customized set of criteria that are content-independent. But if we can incorporate the first four items in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a>, I&#8217;d be super happy. The rest of the criteria, while important, are harder to assess and implement, and have greater impact on  design.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has agreed to start gradually rolling out new accessibility guidelines every other month while educating developers to help them get on board. The first requirement will be Skip Links, followed by the other three that are outlined in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Handbook</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skip Links</strong><br />\nThemes must include a mechanism that enables users to navigate directly to content or navigation on entering any given page. These links may be positioned off screen initially but must be available to screen reader users and must be visible on focus for sighted keyboard navigators.</li>\n<li><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong><br />\nTheme authors must provide visual keyboard focus highlighting in navigation menus and for form fields, submit buttons and text links. All controls and links must be reachable using the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Controls</strong><br />\nAll theme features that behave as buttons or links must use button, input, or a elements, to ensure native keyboard accessibility and interaction with screen reader accessibility APIs.<br />\nAll controls must also have machine-readable text to indicate the nature of the control.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Labeling</strong><br />\nComment forms must have appropriate field labels and all content within form tags need to be explicitly associated to a form control. Post-submission responses (errors or confirmations) must be perceivable. If you are using the default WordPress comment or search forms, these pass the accessibility-ready criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The changed requirement wouldn’t encompass all the accessibility-ready requirements to be present on the standard themes, nor would it automatically make them accessibility-ready, but by incorporating one by one requirements, through longer time period, the idea is to encourage theme authors to write accessible themes out of the box,&#8221; TRT member Denis Žoljom said.</p>\n<p>The team is also re-examining the efficacy of the Trusted Authors program and whether there is evidence for discontinuing it. They are considering removing the child theme queue, which was incentivizing authors to submit more child themes since the queue moves faster than the regular one.</p>\n<p>Imposing stricter accessibility requirements for WordPress.org themes is one suggestion that theme authors discussed over the weekend as a potential response to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-release-free-chaplin-theme-designed-for-block-editor-theme-authors-discuss-better-ways-to-promote-truly-free-themes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org&#8217;s growing problem with crippleware</a>. The expectation is that stricter requirements would shorten the queue of themes ready for review and perhaps even motivate companies to invest in accessibility testing to improve that process. While it may not have a direct affect on theme companies&#8217; ability to produce crippleware, it makes the barrier for entry higher so that reviewers have more time to focus on improvements to the directory and the review process.</p>\n<p>The new accessibility requirements will apply to all themes hosted on WordPress.org, not just new ones entering the directory. Existing themes will be expected to meet the requirements as they pass through the review process for updates. However, the team will not be actively hunting down old themes to suspend them. Today&#8217;s decision marks an important turning point that has the potential to have a ripple effect across the entire theme industry, as WordPress.org sets the standard for theme development. These new requirements give legs to WordPress&#8217; commitment to accessibility in what TRT member Justin Tadlock called &#8220;a small but major step toward accessibility for all in the directory.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Jul 2019 23:24:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: The News Project Launches Its First Customer Site CALmatters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91539\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/the-news-project-launches-its-first-customer-site-calmatters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2798:\"<p><a href=\"https://thenewsproject.net\">The News Project</a> founded by Merril Brown has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/the-news-projects-publishing-platform-goes-live-with-its-first-customer-calmatters/\">launched</a> its first customer site, <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/blogs/inside-calmatters/2019/07/introducing-a-new-look-for-calmatters/\">CALmatters</a>.

We found a last-minute replacement, but it piqued my curiosity as to better alternatives and I commissioned this survey of eight bakeries to answer the question: What&#8217;s the best Doberge cake in Houston or New Orleans? The article and pictures that follow are from <a href=\"https://alicelevitt.com/\">food critic, travel journalist, and medical science writer Alice Levitt</a>. I hope you enjoy the history, reviews, and surprise winner.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1885, Budapest. Franz Josef I and his wife, Elizabeth, rulers of Austro-Hungary, are attending the National General Exhibition of Budapest. There is much to see, but the emperor’s sweet tooth is pulling him toward one particular display. He simply must taste this new cake he’s been hearing about. He must find the Dobos torte.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-49673\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just any cake. With increased ease in shipping products across the continent thanks to better rail links, Jozsef Dobos&nbsp;had set a goal of getting his cakes into homes across Europe. But while trains were fast they weren’t refrigerated, and fluffy whipped cream-layered fancies would quickly become rancid mush in a hot railway carriage. Innovative delicatessen owner Dobos created the solution: a five-layer cake that took a cue from France with a filling of stable chocolate buttercream, a trend that hadn’t yet hit central Europe. Each layer of vanilla sponge worked with its spackling of buttercream like a well-designed piece of modern architecture, keeping itself cool and dry (but not too dry).&nbsp; For a final flourish — and still more shelf-stability — the whole cake got a crisp caramel jacket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dobos, a proponent of open source before it had a name, gave his recipe to the Budapest Confectioner’s and Gingerbread Maker’s Chamber of Industry in 1906 with the stipulation that it must be shared with anyone who wanted it. The cake traveled widely. Now with seven layers, it made its way to America through Jewish delis that sold it as Seven-Layer Cake. Upscale shops like the St. Moritz Bakery in Greenwich, Connecticut, enrobed it in dark chocolate instead of caramel. For its final bit of Americanization, it turned from a round cake into a rectangle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1933, New Orleans. It was never this hot in Hungary. Beulah Ledner, with her Eastern European blood, was not made for it. Neither were certain cakes, it turned out. During the Great Depression, she earned extra money for her family crafting the German confections her mother had taught her to make.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One favorite was Dobos torte. But despite its Hungarian hardiness, it was not created with sticky Louisiana summers in mind. The wintry pastry needed to lighten up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some bakers had ballooned their cakes to 11 layers. Ledner stuck with a more modest eight. But her stroke of genius was replacing the rich buttercream between the layers with airier custard. Buttercream still made an appearance surrounding the cake, which was then covered in a layer of fondant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She knew no one in New Orleans would take to an Eastern European cake,” her son Albert Ledner told <em>Country Roads</em> magazine. “So she Frenchified the name and called it ‘Doberge.’” With that, the pastry’s fate as a New Orleans classic, alongside King Cake and beignets, was sealed. Her Lowerline Street bakery flooded with customers who called her “the Doberge Queen of New Orleans,” perhaps not realizing that she had invented both the cake and the name. Her business grew into a new spot on South Claiborne Avenue and a new name — the Mrs. Charles Ledner Bakery. The torte options grew, too. Chocolate was the standard flavor, but there were lemon, caramel, and strawberry versions. The half-and-half cake, which allowed customers the option to taste chocolate and lemon in a single go, became the most beloved version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite her success, Ledner sold the business and all its recipes in 1946, blaming health issues and World War II sugar rations. The purchaser, Joe Gambino, adhered strictly to her recipes. He opened his shop, Joe Gambino’s Bakery, in 1949 and has served the cakes to New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana, ever since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Ledner, part of her deal with Gambino included a five-year embargo on opening a new bakery in New Orleans. But she could only sit still for two, and debuted the Beulah Ledner Bakery in nearby Jefferson Parish in 1948. Demand forced her to change locations yet again and she expanded to Metairie, this time with a bakery designed and built by her architect son. Ledner ran that last bakery until 1981, when she retired at the age of 87. She ate a slice of Doberge for her birthday every year, including at her 94th and final celebration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Doberge’s sugary tendrils also made their way into nearby Houston. There are six businesses in Space City that sell either Doberge or the more classic Jewish-deli-style Seven-Layer Cake. But how to know which to buy for your next birthday? I sampled all six, as well as the best of New Orleans, to figure out which should be avoided and which are worthy centerpieces for a special occasion. They are listed here from worst to best.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Disappointment<br />The Dobasche, <a href=\"http://raosbakery.com/\">Rao’s Bakery</a> </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White and double fudge</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Menu says six, but I only got four</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Vanilla and chocolate pudding, purportedly</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Fudge icing, ganache top, and walnuts on the sides</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Just the walnuts</li><li><strong>Pickup experience</strong>: Quick and easy, even on Easter</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or lemon</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 6”, 8”, quarter, half, or full sheets</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnny Rao opened the original location of his bakery in Beaumont on 1941, almost matching the vintage of Ledner’s cakes. The Champions-area bakery, at the top of North Houston’s internationally varied Veterans Memorial Drive, opened in 2006. Things seemed promising despite the strange spelling, “Dobasche.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a cheerful place, full of families on a Sunday morning, but the cake didn’t live up to the pleasant experience of the bakery. What made this a Doberge? Nothing, really. The four fat layers of cake alternated between too-light chocolate and white. Though the description on the menu said there were both vanilla and chocolate pudding fillings, I could only find a meager swipe of vanilla buttercream holding the layers together. The exterior fudge icing tasted suspiciously like it had been made by Duncan Hines.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>Runners Up<br />Chocolate Daubache, <a href=\"https://fgbakery.com/\">French Gourmet Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Vanilla</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six — four thin, two thick</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Fudge icing</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: More of the same fudge icing</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: A few swirls on top</li><li><strong>Pickup experience</strong>: Exceptional. The counter staffer even offered to carry the cake to the car.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or strawberry</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 8”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ramain family has been running this ladies-who-lunch destination since 1973. Yes, the raison d’être is French-inspired mousse cakes, macarons, and eclairs, but there’s a menu of “American Cakes,” too. The Daubache is served with strawberry filling by default, but is available in a chocolate version as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The six layers here were the most uneven, with two thick ones in the middle resembling buck teeth in a sea of average-sized chompers. There was nothing truly wrong with this cake, but it was really just an acceptable, if slightly oversweet, layer cake with nothing to distinguish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Seven-Layer Chocolate Cake, <a href=\"https://3brothersbakery.com/\">Three Brothers Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy, vanilla-scented<br /><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven<br /><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate buttercream<br /><strong>Exterior</strong>: Fudge icing<br /><strong>Decorations</strong>: Icing swirls and chocolate sprinkles with a cherry on top.<br /><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Placed the order online, and pick-up was friendly and easy.<br /><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or mocha<br /><strong>Sizes</strong>: One size, which feeds about 10-12</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a cake with history. Why not go to a comparably storied bakery? The Three Brothers saga began in 1825 with the opening of Morris Jucker’s bakery in Chrzanow, Poland. The family continued to run the business there until they were rounded up and sent to a concentration camp in 1941. Brothers Sigmund, Sol, and Max Jucker all survived to open their first Houston bakery in 1949.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the good news. The bad news is that the brothers adapted to American tastes by raising the amount of sugar in their recipes. The buttercream in their Seven Layer Cake made my teeth hurt. But the fudge icing on the outside was less sweet and deeply chocolaty, enhanced with a layer of chocolate sprinkles. I ended up focusing on the perimeter of the large slice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Classic<br />Doberge Cake, Gambino&#8217;s</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy but sturdy and moist vanilla buttermilk cake</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Coffee-infused chocolate custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate buttercream and fondant</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Pretty buttercream flowers</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Was able to pick up from case without pre-ordering.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate, lemon, caramel, or a mix</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 8”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is history. Gambino’s takes great care in crafting every cake, including baking each of its layers separately, rather than cutting one big cake into pieces. Custard is made from scratch for each specimen. And the half-and-half cakes are still one of the Metairie bakery’s best-sellers. I snapped up a chocolate cake straight from the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledner’s attempt at Americanizing her cake by adding more sugar is clear. The buttercream crunched with crystals of it. Combined with the fondant, it was unpleasantly sweet, though I liked the earthiness of the coffee in the chocolate custard.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Original<br />Seven-Layer Dobash Torte, <a href=\"https://www.thevillagebakeryhouston.com/\">Village Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate buttercream</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate buttercream, topped with a layer of lady fingers and caramel</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Nope</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Very pleasant.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Almost endless.</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: Up to you. Cakes are entirely custom.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The name Dobash is misleading; this is no New Orleans delicacy. Of all the cakes I tried, this is closest to Dobos’ original, down to the crunchy coating of caramel, now a rarity. The rectangular shape, however, may owe to Jewish owner Richard Jucker. (I also picked up a day-old bag of his varied, not-too-sweet <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/the-nosher/what-are-hamantaschen/\">Hamantaschen</a> while I was there.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Any resemblance to the Three Brothers cake is no coincidence. Jucker’s father was one of the founders of that bakery and the younger baker worked there from 1981 to 1999. But just as he broke away, this cake is very much its own torte. Fluffy, vanilla-scented layers are surrounded by buttercream that verges on too sweet, especially with the addition of the caramel, but never overwhelms as some of the others do. This is a Dobos torte for the traditionalist — and the client interested in enhancing their cake with flavors like pistachio or almond buttercream. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Upgrade<br />Seven-Layer Cake, <a href=\"https://www.kennyandziggys.com/\">Kenny &amp; Ziggy’s</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Yellow</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate mousse</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate ganache</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Toasted almonds on the sides</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Just chocolate</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: Only one, a whopping two feet, eight inches. Catering director Jeanne Magenheim estimates that each one feeds up to 28 people.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to believe that Houston is home to one of the world’s best remaining Jewish delis, but thanks to living piece of culinary history Ziggy Gruber — whose family came to the U.S. from Hungary in the early 20th century and opened New York’s famous Rialto Deli — it has been since 1999. The Deli Man himself designed his Seven-Layer cake to be a cut above the classic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of buttercream, he ups the ante with intense chocolate mousse. A thick layer of ganache surrounds the outsized square slices of almond-bedecked layer cake. This would be my favorite if not for the too-light cake itself. Just a hint more substance, and this would be close to perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Specialist<br />Chocolate Doberge, <a href=\"https://debbiedoesdoberge.com/\">Debbie Does Doberge</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White, sturdy but moist</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Poured fondant</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: You can request buttercream roses or fleurs de lis.</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Endless, including pistachio, fig/white chocolate/goat cheese, and rum-spiked Bananas Foster.</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 6” through 16”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A designer friend described the cakes here, crafted by Charlotte McGehee and Charles Mary IV, as having the concise beauty of a sports car. Each slice is simply perfect. The balance of each precisely even layer of cake to complementary custard filling feels like eating cake in Plato’s cave.&nbsp; The care taken in each detail is evident, down to the soft, uncommonly edible fondant coating on each slice, whether it covers a well-spiced carrot cake or indulgently minty chocolate one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it the best Doberge being produced in the world today? Almost certainly. But right now, the New Orleans company doesn’t ship. (They hope to start again soon.) When it does, this should be the option (smeared) on everyone’s lips. But until then, I’ll fly to New Orleans just to grab a slice of rainbow-striped cake with almond custard and sigh.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Standout<br />New Orleans Daubache, <a href=\"http://acadianbakers.com/\">The Acadian Bakers</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy vanilla</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Ganache</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Chocolate swirls and hearts, as well as two chocolate-covered strawberries.</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Cake was more than an hour late, with little apology.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Just chocolate</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 9”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acadian Bakers has the best Doberge option for a Houston resident; pastry chef Sandra Bubbert has been turning out craveable cakes for more than 36 years. Luminaries from presidents George H.W.

Chaplin could be loosely described as an agency or business stye theme but the capabilities of the block editor enable users to create advanced page layouts that would suit many different types of websites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chaplin.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The layout for the front page shown in the screenshots can be easily recreated by adding a new page, selecting &#8220;Cover Template&#8221; for the page template, and adding a featured image. Users can then add columns, images, and paragraph text using the block editor to recreate the structure of the demo. Norén has included detailed instructions in the theme&#8217;s readme.txt file for setting it up to look like the demo.</p>\n<p>Font and color settings can both be found in the Customizer and these styles will be reflected in the block editor for a more realistic preview of the content. Chaplin comes with infinite scroll built in and additional settings for displaying and hiding specific post meta on archives and single posts. The theme has logo support, widget areas, a social menu with icons, sticky header support, and a search overlay. Check out the <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/chaplin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the release of WordPress 5.0, Norén worked to get all of his themes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/authors-of-popular-wordpress-org-themes-rolling-out-gutenberg-compatibility-updates-ahead-of-5-0-release\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compatible with the new block editor</a>. Most of his previous themes were created to be niche-specific and easy to have looking just like the demo upon activation. One drawback was that the only way to really customize his themes was to create a child theme and add/or custom CSS, something that is out of reach for most WordPress users.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.andersnoren.se/enter-stage-left-chaplin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing the theme, Norén described how the new block editor inspired him to start building themes differently than he had in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a while, though, I’ve been thinking about how I could build a theme more customizable than the ones I’ve been making so far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the introduction of the Block Editor in WordPress 5.0, any page on a WordPress site can accommodate pretty much any layout, making WordPress itself a lot more flexible than it was just a year ago. If the Block Editor would enable users to create any layout on their site, and the theme would allow them to style the layouts however they want, then that could end up being pretty useful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chaplin is a successful departure from Norén&#8217;s previously static themes that gives users more freedom simply by making the block editor the main vehicle for creating and rearranging the home page layout. No two customizations will look exactly alike because users can arrange blocks in any combination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chaplin-collage-compressed.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This theme is a good example of the possibilities that the block editor opens up for users who want more control of their sites&#8217; layouts and content without having to wade through pages of documentation and dozens of panels of Customizer options. In many ways, themes that fully embrace the block editor are beginning to make older themes seem two-dimensional. This shift in focus is an important milestone in the evolution of theme development.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Theme Authors Discuss Better Ways to Promote Quality Themes on WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Based on the community <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andersnoren/status/1146000192795271168\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to Chaplin&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s clear that there is a real demand for themes made specifically for the block editor. However, WordPress.org is not currently set up to promote themes like this.</p>\n<p>If you filter for &#8220;block editor styles&#8221; and &#8220;wide blocks&#8221; when searching for themes, WordPress.org search currently returns just 26 themes.</p>\n<p>Unless you already know about a specific theme and search for it, the best themes are difficult to find. The Featured and Popular Tabs inside WordPress&#8217; theme browser do little to surface block-ready themes.</p>\n<p>In a related <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1147472529113698311\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> that popped up over the weekend, long time Theme Review Team member Justin Tadlock contends that the WordPress.org theme directory is &#8220;becoming little more than a crippleware distributor.&#8221; He is referring to those themes that do not enable users to further customize them but rather lock away certain features behind upsells.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Essentially, many themes submitted are a &#8216;lite&#8217; or &#8216;free&#8217; version of a commercial theme with extremely reduced functionality,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;For example, we had a theme author trying to upsell access to post formats (a core feature) the other day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fellow Theme Review Team member Danny Cooper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannycooper147/status/1147569548855562245\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cited</a> Elementor&#8217;s Hello Theme as one example of &#8220;the new breed of themes that only exist to &#8216;sell&#8217; something else.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Participants in the discussion suggested WordPress.org employ stricter enforcement of upsells or implement a more nuanced tag system that would identify themes that have some features locked for users who don&#8217;t purchase an upgrade. Others suggested theme authors meet the minimum accessibility requirements as a new threshold for entry into the directory, which would likely slash the number of themes waiting to be reviewed and incentivize companies to invest in accessibility testing to improve that process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I would prefer all themes with upsell to be filtered out into their own section of the directory, so it’s clear to visitors what themes are free and what themes are &#8216;free,&#8217; Norén said in response to the discussion. &#8220;It would also reduce the incentive for theme shops to flood the directory with crippled themes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén is one of a handful of theme authors who are submitting high quality themes to the directory that are truly free from upsells. In a time when it&#8217;s still not common to find new themes built specifically for the block editor, WordPress.org might benefit from featuring these themes in the same way it does for block-enabled plugins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 22:10:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 359 – Diversity Speaker Training With Jill Binder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91436&preview=true&preview_id=91436\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-359-diversity-speaker-training-with-jill-binder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2523:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://jillbinder.com/\">Jill Binder</a>, Founder, and Chief Consultant and Trainer at <a href=\"http://diversein.tech\">Diverse Speakers In Tech</a>.

More than 500 million websites use robots.txt files to talk to bots, according to Google&#8217;s data. Up until now, there has never been an official Internet standard, no documented specification for writing the rules correctly according to the protocol. Over the years, developers shared their various interpretations of the protocol, but this created many different ambiguous methods for controlling crawlers.</p>\n<p>Google is working together with Martijn Koster, the original author of the protocol, webmasters, and other search engines to <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/rep-id.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create a proposal</a> to submit to the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/standards/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) for standardizing the REP:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The proposed REP draft reflects over 20 years of real world experience of relying on robots.txt rules, used both by Googlebot and other major crawlers, as well as about half a billion websites that rely on REP. These fine grained controls give the publisher the power to decide what they&#8217;d like to be crawled on their site and potentially shown to interested users. It doesn&#8217;t change the rules created in 1994, but rather defines essentially all undefined scenarios for robots.txt parsing and matching, and extends it for the modern web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The proposed specification includes several major items that webmasters and developers will want to review. It extends the use of robots.txt to any URI-based transfer protocol (FTP, CoAP, et al), instead of limiting it to HTTP. It also implements a new maximum caching time of 24 hours and lets website owners update robots.txt whenever they choose, without having crawlers overload their sites with requests. If a previously accessible robots.txt file becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, crawlers will respect the known disallowed pages that were previously identified for &#8220;a reasonably long period of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google has also <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/07/googles-robotstxt-parser-is-now-open.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced</a> the C++ library it uses for parsing and matching rules in robots.txt files, along with a testing tool for testing the rules. Developers can use this parser to create parsers that use the proposed REP requirements. It has been updated to ensure that Googlebot only crawls what it&#8217;s allowed to and is now <a href=\"https://github.com/google/robotstxt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This library has been around for 20 years and it contains pieces of code that were written in the 90&#8217;s,&#8221; Google&#8217;s Search Open Sourcing team said in the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/repp-oss.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;Since then, the library evolved; we learned a lot about how webmasters write robots.txt files and corner cases that we had to cover for, and added what we learned over the years also to the internet draft when it made sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lizzi Harvey, who maintains Google&#8217;s Search developer docs, updated the robots.txt spec to match the REP draft. Check out the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_txt#what-changed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full list of changes</a> if you want to compare your robots.txt file to the proposed spec. If the proposal for standardizing the REP is successfully adopted by the IETF, the days of googling and wading through undocumented robots.txt rules will soon be over.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2019 19:11:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Font Awesome is Branching out with Duotone Colors and Icon Smashups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91328\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/font-awesome-is-branching-out-with-duotone-colors-and-icon-smashups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2617:\"<p><a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&v=5.9.0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome 5.9</a> was released last month with 421 new and updated icons.

I was “gifted” so learning came easy and I enjoyed it.  From ages 6 to 18, I went to competitive accelerated schools designed to churn out college students. It was a narrow path I’d been set on, without encouragement to explore beyond.</p>\n<p>Majoring in theater was a no-brainer. It was the only thing I’d done my whole life, so I figured I wouldn’t get bored. My mom was a stage manager so it has always been easy to bring me to rehearsals with her when working a show. I ended up in close to 20 different productions between 5 and 13. Plus, Florida State University had a great theatre program and in-state tuition was cheap. So I went.</p>\n<p>But I wasn’t there because I wanted to be. I’d gone simply because I felt I <i>had</i> to go to college, regardless of what I did when I got there. I liked theater a lot, but I didn’t love it the way my classmates did. Self-doubt crept in. Depression overcame me. Anxiety and self-hatred took root. I stopped going to class. I isolated myself from my friends who &#8211; going through their own stuff &#8211;  were too busy to notice.</p>\n<p>At 19, I dropped out.</p>\n<h3>Straying from the path</h3>\n<p>With me, I took thousands in debt, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and a bruised ego. I wandered, directionless for the first time in my life.</p>\n<p>I felt like a failure. I did not know who or what I was anymore, I had no community and I belonged nowhere. I was crippled by my concurrent depression and lack of a diploma. What was my path now?</p>\n<p>My mother spent her whole life working in the arts and that made her happy. I wanted the same thing. But we were always pinching pennies. I didn’t want that for myself, and I didn’t want my kids to grow up with that burden. So I thought to myself, “What can I do that’s creative, won’t be boring, and can earn me an income?”</p>\n<p>I don’t remember if there was a lightbulb moment where I realized web design checked all my boxes. But that was there I landed.</p>\n<p>I started getting my toes wet with HTML and CSS, but coding didn’t come easily to me. I didn’t have a computer, so I would write out lines of code by hand in order to memorize syntax. It didn’t click and just swam in front of my eyes. It was difficult, so I gave up.</p>\n<p>For a year and a half, I lived in a few different cities, from Ft Lauderdale all the way to Los Angeles, working some retail and food service jobs. I learned about customer service, the balance between maintenance and growth, and found myself more than a little bit fascinated by marketing.  I began to learn how to juggle the depression and anxiety that lived in my head.</p>\n<p>No matter where I went, web design was sitting in the back of my brain. I was shut down when I tried to suggest changes to the booking system of a salon I worked at. I found myself sketching redesigns of the website of the bar where I picked up shifts. I started learning again after moving back to Florida. This time, I found online resources like Udemy and CodeSchool and it all began to click.</p>\n<h3>Finding a new path</h3>\n<p>While I still didn’t love code itself, I loved the idea of building something from nothing. It all hearkened back to theater: rallying the knowledge and experience of multiple people, laying out a plan, inventing some creative solutions along the way, iteration after iteration until it functions and yields a result, then presenting it as a living and breathing product. I had learned about story-telling via script analysis classes in college as well as spacing and color psychology. I had always been academic, so I found ease and comfort in things like databases and content writing. My intellectual and creative side were merging, dancing together in one elegant performance.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I applied for a web design internship at a small agency. It was here where WordPress and I first met. I was amazed that I could easily build websites with limited coding knowledge. I attended my first WordCamp in Miami, where I watched people like Morten Hendricksen and Michelle Schlup live what I wished I could be doing.</p>\n<p>I was promoted to a full employee in a poisonous environment. I had to work long hours and was accused of not being a team player if I didn’t. I was guilt-tripped with gifts and compliments. I was asked to do tasks I hadn’t been trained in and was berated when I struggled. I left one day after about a year, in tears. The despair, loneliness and frustration were unassailable.  I had failed, yet again, to move forward on the path I felt I belonged on.</p>\n<h3>Setting my own path</h3>\n<p>I had no savings and no car, so I was left with a choice: apply to work at the Wendy’s that was walking distance up the street, or find a way to make money out of thin air. Taking inventory of my skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I knew WordPress</li>\n<li>I knew how <i>not</i> to run a business</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I started building small sites for friends and family. I scrambled to learn how to invoice properly, how to handle contracts, how to get taxes paid. I googled a lot and failed often. But it was rewarding and creative, so I stuck to it.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I felt confident enough to apply to speak at WordCamp Miami. It had been 2 years since I had attended the first and I was floored when I was accepted.</p>\n<p>In the three years that I ran my business, I worked with clients from all over the world. I used WordPress daily to build and break, support and scale websites for other business owners like me. I wore every hat I could balance: CEO, CFO, designer, developer, marketer, and support staff in one.</p>\n<p>While I appeared “successful” (whatever that means) I was paddling like crazy beneath the surface and was constantly stretched to my limit. I achieved decent work-life boundaries and found satisfaction in the work, but being depressed while running a business is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, as my bank account began to dry up, I began to seriously consider throwing in the towel.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>I spoke at WordCamp Miami that year. The entire camp buoyed my spirits; this time, there were faces and topics I recognized. I went with my friend, Louise Treadwell, who made the entire experience less frightening.</p>\n<p>And the universe was looking out for me. The very first person I met that day was Adam Warner.</p>\n<p>He saw my talk and I suppose he saw something in me that he liked. By the end of the conference, my head was swimming with the opportunity he had presented to me: to travel as a GoDaddy Pro Speaker Ambassador.</p>\n<p>I felt that electric sensation again of my two halves &#8211; academic and creative &#8211; merging. It was the first time the community had reached out and taken a firm, confident grasp of my hand. And I was in exactly the right spot to accept it.</p>\n<p>The idea of attending more WordCamps was thrilling. I vowed to myself that I would up my Twitter game. After all, all my WordCamp heroes were active on Twitter and I was desperate to be where the action was.</p>\n<p>I grabbed as many opportunities as I could to remain visible. I wrote blog posts and made YouTube videos to prove what I knew, to myself as much as others. I wanted to earn my place at the table by giving back into the community that had plucked me out of my despair.</p>\n<h3>Time to merge</h3>\n<p>I’d done a podcast episode with Michelle Ames and I noticed she worked for the plugin, GiveWP. Out of curiosity, I wandered over to their careers page and saw an opening for a support tech. I had the job within 3 days.</p>\n<p>I’ve done a lot of things out of fear that many people find brave. I was told I was brave for majoring in theater, but I’d done it because I didn’t want to fail at something unfamiliar. I was told I was brave for moving to Los Angeles after I dropped out, but I was afraid to be stagnant. I was told I was brave to start my own business, but I was afraid to work for someone else.</p>\n<p>I do feel fear. Fear that I don’t know enough, that I’m too young or inexperienced, that I’ll let down the people who have cheered me on, that I’ll end up vulnerable the way I was in my last job. That I’ll get hurt. That being a black, queer, woman in the tech space will be too challenging.</p>\n<p>I’m comforted by the knowledge that most WordPress people don’t care what gender/color/sexuality you are… as long as you keep your plugins updated. Open-source means you’re not here to out-do the next person, but to contribute toward a common goal. I can dive into support at Give with WordPress as my base, my constant. I can finally acknowledge that I am worth being part of a team. It means all the difference in the world.</p>\n<h3>Who invented this path nonsense anyway?</h3>\n<p>I don’t have to be on a path anymore. I can let myself remain open to possibilities and say “yes” more. I don’t have to decide what I’m going to be, <i>I can just become it,</i> because I can trust myself and the foundation that WordPress has given me. WordPress, with it’s limitless contributors, versions, and possibilities, reminds us that we should be excited by change, not afraid.</p>\n<p>I believe that giving up what I worked for 3 years to build is the bravest thing I’ve done so far. At first, I was furious at myself that I couldn’t make my own business as sustainable as I’d wanted. Moving to Give felt like failing. But Louise called it “failing up” which I think is pretty apt. It was a step forward into something I could grow into and really succeed at, rather than sticking with the familiar like I had always done.</p>\n<p>I often remind myself of a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer which, ironically, I watched for the first time while in some the deepest throes of my depression: <i>“</i><i>I&#8217;m cookie dough. I&#8217;m not done baking. I&#8217;m not finished becoming who ever the hell it is I&#8217;m gonna turn out to be.” </i></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I Am Cookie Dough\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20Am%20Cookie%20Dough&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: I Am Cookie Dough\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F&title=I+Am+Cookie+Dough\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070319-150x150.jpg&description=I Am Cookie Dough\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/\" title=\"I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/\">I Am Cookie Dough</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2019 12:00:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Allie Nimmons\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Walking 718km to WCEU, an Interview With Marcel Bootsman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91357\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/walking-748km-to-wceu-an-interview-with-marcel-bootsman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2209:\"<p>I have a hard time walking a mile or two let alone 718km, but that&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbootsman\">Marcel Bootsman</a> did on his journey to <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">WordCamp EU</a> to generate funds for <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview, Bootsman explains how he prepared for the journey, what he experienced during his trip, and why he chose DonateWC as the charity to raise funds for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I was curious about was what Bootsman thought about during those long stretches where he had plenty of time to think to himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The thing that I noticed is that my thinking had changed during the month.

Although the plugin hasn&#8217;t officially launched yet, a <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/demo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the website allows people to anonymously publish a post to msgWP&#8217;s demo blog from their own Telegram accounts by launching a Telegram bot.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s creator, <a href=\"https://github.com/meszarosrob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Róbert Mészáros</a>, said he plans to launch it in late summer or early fall, after collecting more feedback from beta testers and polishing the website. Mészáros is a developer who mainly works on a contract or freelance basis. Although msgWP isn&#8217;t is first WordPress plugin, it is the first one he has created as a product to promote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s highly unlikely that I&#8217;ll make msgWP available on the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, but it&#8217;s going to be GPL licensed,&#8221; Mészáros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support, automatic updates, and restricted content will be available only for those who buy a plan. Since I&#8217;m using msgWP myself and I plan to donate a part of profit back to the community, to the WordPress Foundation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the plugins available that integrate Telegram with WordPress either broadcast to a channel or display the feed of a public channel in a widget. This is the first plugin that sends Telegram user-generated content into WordPress.</p>\n<p>I tested the demo last night and successfully posted a text to the demo blog. Images do not yet appear to be working on the demo or may be disabled for now. Mészáros said the demo implementation unhooks some of the checks that are enabled by default on the plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-02-at-12.36.31-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>When the msgWP plugin is used on a site, administrators need to allow a Telegram account to create posts explicitly. This setting is available in the admin screen where you can enter the username of a Telegram account. Adding multiple usernames to the whitelist opens up some interesting possibilities for group blogging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since every Telegram message contains information about the Telegram account, we can filter out those who are not whitelisted,&#8221; Mészáros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, the fact that users are explicitly whitelisted opens up the way to have user level settings. For example, you can set a specific category for a Telegram account or only give them the option to create draft posts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you whitelist yourself you have a microblog; if you whitelist 20 users with various settings, you can cover a live event with Telegram and msgWP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The msgWP plugin also checks the IP of the request. If it falls outside a particular IP range, msgWP can recognize that it&#8217;s not from Telegram and block it.</p>\n<p>Mészáros&#8217; inspiration for the plugin came from his principles regarding centralized social media. While he maintains a private blog where his friends follow him, Mészáros&#8217; doesn&#8217;t use platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel strongly about blogging and microblogging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s not all rainbows – if you have one, you know that it takes a certain kind of commitment and effort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mészáros said he was also inspired &#8220;by an almost forgotten history of WordPress,&#8221; wherein many took advantage of its support for XML-RPC to blog from desktop blog editors, like MarsEdit, BlogJet, and BlogDesk, without ever logging into the admin. He contends that third-party tools like this demonstrate that <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/what-is-wordpress-without-its-editor-we-are-not-sure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is more than the editor</a>.</p>\n<p>Since msgWP is already integrated into the messaging workflow for Telegram users, it may inspire some to blog more often. Posting is faster than using Twitter, Facebook, or even the WordPress mobile apps, albeit with far fewer features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradoxically we want to encourage people to use WordPress by not reminding them that they run their sites/microblogs on WordPress,&#8221; Mészáros said. &#8220;A messaging app has some informality to it, and that will help a lot. All you need is to write and press send. After all, you are sending texts, and not publishing structured articles on your blog after too many glasses of wine. For this reason, we don&#8217;t see msgWP with Telegram as a replacement for the WP Mobile Apps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the convenience promised through various apps, the concept of microblogging on one&#8217;s own website does not seem to have taken off yet. Services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">micro.blog</a>, which integrate with existing WordPress blogs, are still used by a fervent few and have not yet gained mainstream adoption. Even the “Press This” feature that was included in WordPress core prior to 2017, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/press-this-removed-from-wordpress-4-9-in-favor-of-a-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">retired in favor of a canonical plugin</a>, with discontinued support for the bookmarklet feature. It hasn&#8217;t been updated for two years and is only installed on approximately 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Postcard, a social sharing and microblogging app that integrated with WordPress, is another tool that was aimed at fundamentally changing how people use social networks. It was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/postcard-project-discontinued-ios-and-android-apps-now-open-source\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discontinued due to the development burden</a> of supporting multiple apps.</p>\n<p>There are many different solutions that have popped up over the years for enabling quick posts or microblogging, all with vastly different approaches. msgWP has an advantage in that Mészáros can leverage the power and speed of Telegram, along with all of its mobile and desktop clients, without having to maintain that aspect of the publishing interface. Even if it doesn&#8217;t spark a wildfire of microblogging across the web, it may offer users a convenient alternative to posting content inside social media silos, especially for niche use cases like group microblogging for live events.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:36:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Matt: Just Write with David Perell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=49754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://ma.tt/2019/07/just-write-with-david-perrell/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:594:\"<p>I had an <a href=\"https://www.perell.com/podcast/matt-mulleweg\">interesting conversation with David Perell on his North Star Podcast that I recommend checking out</a>.

The 28-minute video explores how quickly the project began to have an impact on the wider tech industry after Facebook publicly released it as an open source project.</p>\n<p>GraphQL co-founder Nick Schrock, who was interviewed along with fellow co-creators Lee Byron and Dan Schafer, said the documentary &#8220;captured both the urgency and joy of the early months of the GraphQL.&#8221; It was filmed over two months in San Francisco and Berlin, where Honeypot runs the <a href=\"https://www.graphqlconf.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GraphQL Conf</a> in cooperation with <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prisma</a>.</p>\n<p>GraphQL began as an internal project at Facebook that was born out of necessity as the tech industry began to shift towards providing better mobile experiences for users. At that time, Facebook&#8217;s native apps were just a thin wrapper around the mobile website.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The inability of a large technology company to adjust to a technology shift as big as the mobile shift is the type of thing that will consign a seemingly unstoppable empire to the grave in a matter of a few years,&#8221; Schrock said.</p>\n<p>Facebook decided to re-write the Facebook iOS app but the APIs they had at that time were inadequate for creating the Newsfeed. A new Newsfeed API was written simultaneously to be used with the new mobile app. Facebook for iOS 5.0, released in 2012, was a native re-write of the app and also the first time GraphQL was deployed in the wild. Following that release, its use was expanded beyond just the Newsfeed to encompass most of the functionality offered in Facebook&#8217;s iOS app.</p>\n<p>Facebook shared GraphQL with the world at React Europe 2015 and published the GraphQL spec later in 2015. They explained that their goal was to design what they thought was the ideal API for frontend developers and work backwards with the technology.</p>\n<p>GraphQL&#8217;s creators were surprised at how fast the uptake was after making the project public. Engineers at Airbnb, Twitter, and Github were early adopters and their experiences are shared in the documentary with interviews from the community. The problems GraphQL&#8217;s creators encountered in scaling their mobile experience were not specific to Facebook. Other companies had similar problems and the demand for GraphQL in the industry was already there. Within six months, the team saw implementations of GraphQL in many of the major programming languages. They realized how important the project was to the industry after <a href=\"https://github.blog/2016-09-14-the-github-graphql-api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub announced in 2016 that its public API would be a GraphQL API</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using GraphQL on the frontend and backend eliminates the gap between what we release and what you can consume. We really look forward to making more of these simultaneous releases. GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated documentation, and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The documentary tells the story of how GraphQL began the first three years as a solution to internal problems at Facebook but expanded to become a community tool that was initially adopted by hobbyists and then incorporated into the products of large tech companies. GraphQL co-founder Lee Byron predicts that the project is entering the next phase of its life and &#8220;heading towards becoming an industry standard and one that&#8217;s collaborative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no way to measure the number of APIs that are being built around GraphQL, but the query language is now used  in both internal and external APIs at major companies like Pinterest, Intuit, Coursera, Walmart, Shopify, PayPal, KLM, NBC News Digital, Credit Karma, Wayfair, and Yelp. Since it can be used in combination with REST APIs, GraphQL&#8217;s rapid adoption is not necessarily a good predictor for the end of REST architecture, but it&#8217;s a trend that is worth following. This widespread adoption began with just a handful of engineers who saw GraphQL&#8217;s promise at React Europe 2015, built tools to optimize development, and advocated for using GraphQL at their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I totally underestimated the power of these open source communities,&#8221; Schrock said. &#8220;We had to rely on this community of poeple to form spontaneously and then build implementations of this in different languages and then actually productionize it and build an entire tool ecosystem around it. I didn&#8217;t think that was ever going to work, and I was totally wrong. If an idea makes sense to people and it clicks with their mind and they can see the vision, they are actually willing to do a lot of work in order to see it executed and share their work, and it&#8217;s a pretty remarkable thing to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The energy in the GraphQL documentary is inspiring and the story shares many parallels with other open source projects that have gained widespread adoption through passionate communities.

Jenny&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7D5p25NyAk\">interview</a> with <strong>Torque</strong> at WCEU is worth a listen too. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f31e.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li><li><strong>John Jacoby</strong>’s talk on “<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/advanced-database-management-for-plugins/\">Advanced Database Management For Plugins</a>” explored the pain of dealing with databases when you&#8217;re writing plugins. He also announced a stand-alone open source library for better WordPress database management that will be released in July.</li><li><strong>Josepha Haden</strong>&#8216;s talk entitled “<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/change-your-socks-change-your-mind-a-no-fuss-primer-on-change-management/\">Change your socks, change your mind: A no-fuss primer on change management</a>” focused on the things group and community leaders should attend to most during periods of significant change. That&#8217;s a timely subject, given the events of the past year, and Josepha&#8217;s points apply to many parts of the WordPress community. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f9e6.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt’s talk after lunch on Friday was more of an update on Gutenberg. Matt presented some Gutenberg stats and then put the spotlight on some new block editor plugins and experiments. Matt reminded everyone that Gutenberg is in phase two, “where we are working with widgets (old school blocks), customization, and menus.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Matt&#8217;s Session</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Matt showed off the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/grids/\"><strong>Grid</strong> block plugin</a> from <strong>Evolve</strong> that generates any layout style with a slick UI. You have to see it in action.</li><li>Gutenberg is now <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\">available for <strong>Drupal</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>There are about 150k posts published each day with Gutenberg. That&#8217;s about two every second, and ta rate is increasing.</li><li>Gutenberg will soon have:<ul><li>A block directory that&#8217;s accessible from the “top-level navigation” on the .org site.</li><li>Footnotes and improved “micro” animations.</li><li>Special attention placed on the mobile experience. Matt noted that &#8220;Gutenberg for mobile is live, and the ability [to use its features] is increased now in the mobile apps.&#8221; He also mentioned they &#8220;had to write the codebase separately for this experience.&#8221;</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial questions Matt got from the audience were somewhat aggressive and prolonged, so the moderators found it a challenge to keep things moving. At one point, a moderator broke in to say, “This isn’t a question; it’s a blog post.” I’m wondering if in the future at WCEU (or the upcoming WordCamp US) if a different moderation process might be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to choose one question of note, it would be the one asked about Matt&#8217;s (and WordPress’s) commitment to accessibility. Matt replied, “Accessibility is hard. We will get there. I believe we can make every release of WordPress better, but it’s challenging with Gutenberg because there might not be previous examples to work from.” He acknowledged the excellent work that <strong>WPCampus</strong> recently did with its accessibility audit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Saturday Highlights:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday’s talks, like Friday’s, were well done, although the panel on Gutenberg might have had more diversity in its composition, as a few people noted on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two especially notable talks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Brian Teeman</strong>, one of the Joomla co-founders, defined what counts as truly free software. (<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/brianteeman/the-power-of-free-151309934\">Slides</a>) If you have begun to wonder how cloud services and <strong>Jetpack</strong> challenge the concept of &#8220;free,&#8221; check out Brian&#8217;s talk. Brian also has a recent post on his blog with <a href=\"https://brian.teeman.net/web/891-learn-something-new-at-a-conference\">some good advice for conference goers</a>: attend sessions randomly or pick ones with unfamiliar topics if you want to learn the most.</li><li><strong>Marcel Bootsman</strong> gave an inspiring account of his 700km walk to Berlin to attend the conference.

The attendees came from 97 different countries and 1,722 of them had never attended WordCamp Europe before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event featured 60 speakers who delivered talks and workshops on a variety of topics over two conference days, most notably <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>’s keynote that included an update on the current status of WordPress Core development, along with a lively Q&amp;A session. The full session from the live stream is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UE18IsncB7s?t=13033\">available to watch online</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For its eighth year, <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2019/06/25/wordcamp-europe-2020/\">WordCamp Europe will take place in Porto, Portugal</a>.

This is a feature that has traditionally been handled by plugins, which has resulted in many different implementations across different sites. It also means that many sites do not have XML sitemaps, which can be a problem because they are hugely important to having your site correctly indexed by search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal details how core sitemaps would be structured and how the team would build them, as well as what aspects of WordPress would not be considered appropriate information to be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building this feature?

E2e testing, which has been successfully used by Gutenberg, is used to simulate real user scenarios and validate process flows. Currently, the setup requires <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/install/\">Docker</a> to run, and a number of e2e test utilities are already available in the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/e2e-test-utils/src\">@wordpress/e2e-test-utils</a> package, in the Gutenberg repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to use this feature?

Two new packages have been created that require code review and testing. The first is an Autoload Package, a foundational package for theme developers who are not currently using Composer (although <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended instead of this package). The second is a Customizer Section Button Package that allows theme authors to create a link/button to any URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other proposed ideas for packages that require feedback and additional discussion.

The track includes presentations like A React Theme in 30 Min, SEO for Headless WordPress Themes, Gatsby &amp; WordPress, and Headless E-Commerce with BigCommerce.

The scholarship is named after Kim Parsell who <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\">passed away in 2015</a> but her impact on the WordPress community is still felt today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My proudest contribution to the WordPress open source project is training small business owners and bloggers to be comfortable and conversant with their own WordPress websites. WordPress empowers people. Many end users of WordPress are not technically minded. As a WordPress Meetup co-organizer, I contribute to the coffee help desk, assisting others in finding solutions to their WordPress problems. I also host another help desk opportunity, ‘Coffee With Carol,’ to empower WordPress users,&#8221; Gann said.</p>\n<p>I can tell from the quote above that Kim and Carol would get along well as Kim was also the type of person who would do what she could to help others.</p>\n<h2>GravityView Diversity Grant to Attend PressNomics 6</h2>\n<p>The folks over at GravityView are <a href=\"https://gravityview.co/gravityview-diversity-grant/\">offering a grant</a> to recognize the challenges certain groups of people face succeeding in technology fields and to promote inclusivity and diversity. The grant includes a ticket to PressNomics 6, a flight to Tuscon, AZ, lodging, transportation via a Lyft gift card, and a one-on-one business consultation with Zak Katz, Co-founder of GravityView. The deadline to apply is 11:59 PM MDT on June 30, 2019.</p>\n<h2>10up OpenSource Project Scaffolding Suite</h2>\n<p>10up has released a <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2019/project-scaffolds-released/\">project scaffolding suite</a> that includes a WordPress starter theme, starter plugin, and NPM package.

Check out the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/welcome-to-the-wordpress-tavern\">first post</a> I published on the Tavern announcing its opening.</p>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg Announces That Automattic Is Sponsoring Jill Binder&#8217;s Work</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/06/diversifying-wordpress/\">Diversifying&nbsp;WordPress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>John James Jacoby Releases A Plugin That Cryptographically Signs Posts</h2>\n<p>John James Jacoby <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/2019/06/heidenberg/\">has released</a> a <a href=\"https://github.com/JJJ/Heidenberg\">small plugin on GitHub</a> that cryptographically signs posts. The plugin splits the content of posts in words and then stenographically inserts zero-width characters between them. These characters then form a unique, invisible pattern that can be used to detect plagiarised content.

Contributors plan to merge the API with 14 endpoints for popular components like activity updates, groups, members, private messages, and extended profile fields. Another eight endpoints for blogs, friends, and other features, are planned to ship in BuddyPress 6.0.0.</p>\n<p>The first major use of the BP REST API inside BuddyPress is a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12405\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new group management interface</a> that enables administrators to quickly search for specific members to promote, demote, ban, or remove.

GitHub is more convenient for development but some expressed concerns about fragmenting the history of the API&#8217;s development on two platforms.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges said in a recent dev chat that shipping the BP REST API without documentation is a blocker. Contributors are now working on a new documentation site. Since version 5.0.0 will be more of a developer-oriented release, Viet suggested contributors take the opportunity to set up developer.buddypress.org with similar resources as WordPress has on its <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DevHub</a> project. He is looking for feedback on his <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/bp-devhub/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> for automatically generating the documents from the REST schemas of the API&#8217;s endpoints and further customizing it for integration into the broader developer.buddypress.org site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bp-rest-api-reference.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress contributors are targeting August 15 for releasing 5.0.0 beta 1 and will discuss a date for RC further down the road.

The plugin&#8217;s creator, Jeffrey Carandang, said <a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.6</a> was targeted at improving the writing flow for writers, bloggers, and content creators.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg has decent support for copying and pasting Markdown. It will automatically convert links, blockquotes, code snippets, and other formatting into the proper Gutenberg blocks. However, the editor does not offer full support for users who who want to write with Markdown.</p>\n<p>EditorsKit 1.6 adds basic markdown capabilities for things like <em>bold</em>, <em>italic</em> and ~strikethrough~ and these can also be used alongside other available editor markdowns and their keyboard shortcuts. These are integrated directly into the RichText editor so you don&#8217;t have to use a dedicated Markdown plugin with a custom block, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-githuber-md/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Githuber MD</a>, or <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack&#8217;s Markdown module</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EditorsKit 1.6  is now available <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Comes with Gutenberg Editor Markdown Support, Clear Formatting, Subscript &amp; Superscript Formats, Toggle Title and more. Here\'s a quick preview on how these features were integrated on WordPress Gutenberg block editor <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3ac.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/apB4uMjuqg\">pic.twitter.com/apB4uMjuqg</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Jeffrey Carandang (@phpbits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phpbits/status/1135895882216329216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Version 1.6 introduced an expanded &#8220;clear formatting&#8221; option as a response to requests Carandang received on the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1306393256173179/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook community</a> and Slack. It clears formatting on specific text, removes formatting on selected text, and clears all paragraph and heading block formatting using the “Clear Block Formatting” option in the block settings. This version also added subscript, superscript, and uppercase text formats, along with a title visibility toggle that removes titles from the frontend on a per-post basis.</p>\n<p>While these tools may provide features that some users find to be critically missing from Gutenberg, for many others they simply add to the clutter of the block toolbar and the overall interface. Gutenberg is still sorely in need of a distraction-free UI that will enable users to ditch dedicated writing apps and embrace WordPress as their go-to app for writing.</p>\n<p>EditorsKit seems best suited as a playground for features that may or may not have widespread appeal. For example, the most recent <a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-7/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.7 release</a> enables exporting and importing blocks without the requirement of first converting them to reusable blocks. Users can click on the “block settings” icon and export as JSON on a per-block basis.

This week, the team has released two feature packages that illustrate what the project is trying to accomplish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/autoload\">Autoloader</a> that provides the means necessary for theme authors to autoload PHP classes. While <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended, the team has created a PSR-4 compliant autoloader as an alternative for those not ready for Composer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a foundational package that will allow you to use any other  packages that we create,&#8221; Tadlock explained.  &#8220;You could even use it for autoloading your own  theme classes if you choose to do so (assuming they follow the <a href=\"https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/\">PSR-4 autoloading standard</a> for class and folder names).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second package provides a <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/customize-section-button\">Customizer Section Button</a> that enables theme authors to create a link or button that points to a URL. This feature was originally developed to allow developers a standard way to display a Pro/Upsell link within the customizer. However, the package is generic enough that developers can use it to link to any URL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock also provided feedback on a number of ideas that were proposed. Packages up for consideration include, Breadcrumbs, Sliders and Sections, Mobile Navigation, Color Control with Transparency, Appearance > Theme Name Page, and Standard Template Hooks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read his feedback and learn more about the project, including how to get involved, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/24/feature-packages-update/\">feature package update</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">initial proposal</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 01:01:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 6.0 Adds Layout Picker to Columns Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91159\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-6-0-adds-layout-picker-to-columns-block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2325:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-26th-june/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 6.0</a> was released today with a major update to the Columns block. Users can now select from a set of pre-defined layouts for their columns, with additional features that address many long-standing complaints regarding the block&#8217;s usability.</p>\n<p>Although many plugins are already doing more advanced things with columns and grid layouts, WordPress core&#8217;s current implementation of the Columns block is so confusing that it is barely usable. It has a sliding control for selecting the number of columns but it is difficult to see the column boundaries. </p>\n<p>Gutenberg 6.0 gives users the ability to select from multiple pre-defined column options, which include some commonly-requested layouts with variable widths. Users can also elect to skip the layouts and start from scratch. Below is a video demo Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella shared in the release post:</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-video\"><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/12-columns.mp4\">https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/12-columns.mp4</a></div></p>\n<p>The column settings also include a sliding percentage width control, so users can further customize it, whether starting from a template or from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-1.07.16-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In adding pre-defined layouts to columns, the Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16129\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">enhanced the InnerBlocks component</a>, allowing developers to extend it to create their own sets of template options to appear upon inserting a block. The Columns block serves as an example implementation of this.</p>\n<p>This release also incorporates more than a dozen smaller enhancements and fixes, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16020\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">snackbar notice support for the widgets screen</a>.

The data includes responses from more than 11,000 developers in 135 countries. Respondents identified themselves as male (84.71%), female (9.9%), non-binary/third gender (0.86%), and &#8220;prefer not to say&#8221; (2.62%).</p>\n<p>Sacha Greif and Raphaël Benitte, creators of the survey, said it&#8217;s skewed towards early adopters, since the sample size is a fairly small selection of the overall CSS developer community. Greif and Benitte also created the State of JS survey, which is where 31.5% of respondents heard about the CSS survey, so the data is also slanted towards the “back of the front-end,” developers who use JavaScript in their front-end work. They concluded that this data is a good preview of where the mainstream side of the ecosystem will be a few years from now. </p>\n<p>The majority of respondents indicated that they are fairly confident about their <a href=\"https://2019.stateofcss.com/demographics/backend-proficiency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">back-end proficiency</a>, with 62.49% identifying themselves as possessing intermediate or advanced backend skills. This trend sets the bar higher for developers who are looking to present a competitive skill-set in the CSS workforce.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-21-at-5.10.10-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results seem clearly bent towards the JavaScript-proficient segment of CSS developers, with a whopping 80.54% rating their <a href=\"https://2019.stateofcss.com/demographics/javascript-proficiency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript proficiency</a> at Intermediate to Expert level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.24.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The summary includes a highly detailed look at different CSS-related technologies, such as preprocessors, methodologies, frameworks, and CSS-in-JS, with differently colored segments representing whether developers have favorable or negative opinions on each. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.33.12-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>The results contain data visualizations showing which CSS features and technologies developers know about and/or have used in their work. Flexbox (94.4%) and Grid (54.4%) are among the most widely used layout tools. The frameworks section revealed some surprising results, with a few of the lesser-known frameworks, like Tailwind, Bulma, PureCSS, and Tachyon ranking highest in interest and satisfaction. The most well-known frameworks, Bootstrap and Foundation, fall at the bottom of the satisfaction scale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.43.58-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These results are fairly representative of early adopters of new technologies in the CSS ecosystem, covering features and frameworks that are not yet mainstream. Greif and Benitte predict that even though CSS seems to be evolving slowly, mastering the newer technologies will become more important for developers who want to remain competitive. </p>\n<p>For a more detailed look at other areas, such as typography, interactions, animations, and even what pseudo CSS selectors and form-related selectors developers use in their work, check out the full range of results at <a href=\"https://2019.stateofcss.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2019.stateofcss.com</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 14:05:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"HeroPress: How The WordPress Community Helped Me Face My Fears And Do It Anyway\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2898\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-face-my-fears-and-do-it-anyway/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-face-my-fears-and-do-it-anyway\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14240:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/062619-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Be ruthless about self care.\" /><h3>Your comfort zone is a muscle.

You see, I have been a victim of <a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/bullying/article.htm#what_are_the_effects_of_bullying_what_are_the_effects_of_hazing\">(relational) bullying</a> several times during my elementary school years. I changed schools because of it, yet it happened again.</p>\n<p>Bear with me here, this is not going to be a “I feel so sorry for myself” sob story. There is lots of hope, encouragement and empowerment in this story. Yes, I have struggled with feelings of insecurity and feelings of “not being worthwhile”. And yes, every time I think I have finally dealt with it, it does pop up again in another shape or form. But every single time, I have been able to turn it around into an opportunity to grow. I may still depend a bit more on validation than average. But people who know me, will confirm that I am known to be one to encourage others.</p>\n<h3>A little bit of context</h3>\n<p>I won’t wear you out with the whole back story. Instead, let me take you back about 5 years. Me, my husband, and my two kids had been living in the Caribbean for a number of years. Unfortunately, I had hit another rough patch. I had been working with a wonderful local psychologist, but I was not getting the results I hoped for. And then it hit me: I would not be growing without intentionally seeking out opportunities to grow. So I decided to send myself out on an experiment. And, thankfully we were able to afford an experiment like that.</p>\n<h3>Being intentional about personal development</h3>\n<p>One of the goals I set, was to be able to present myself as a digital marketing expert more comfortably. And I felt that it would be easier to do this outside my local area since I was running a pattern of playing small there. So I purchased a ticket to WordCamp Miami (a short flight away). As I started to freak out about what I had done, an email came in. The organization was looking for volunteers. Perfect timing. That would help me focus on helping others rather than feeling lost and not knowing whom to talk to. Or getting all hyper from butterflying around.</p>\n<p>This turned out to be a great decision. I had never encountered a community more inviting and inclusive. I had a blast during the weekend. And even got invited over for a home-cooked dinner by one of my co-volunteers. Some first lasting friendships were born that weekend.</p>\n<p>Having this first volunteer experience under my belt landed me several volunteer gigs in the US over the following years. Not only for WordCamps, but also for a much more expensive internet marketing conferences and coaching programs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mynams-2015.jpg\"><img /></a>One of the events I got to volunteer at, was MyNAMS 2015. I was first timer, volunteer and (assistant) trainer at the same time.</p>\n<h3>Starting all over again</h3>\n<p>Then, three years ago, we moved back to The Netherlands, and I had no professional network in my home country at all. So, once our family had found a new routine, I signed up as a volunteer for WordCamp Europe in Paris (2017). That made me stretch far out of my comfort zone since about 2000 people would attend, and I did not know one single soul. Signing up as a volunteer was a no-brainer already by that time. To help myself get over some anxiety about the number of people attending, I decided to sign up for contributors day for the first time. After all, “only” some 300 people would attend that event.</p>\n<p>The friendly people at the marketing team adopted me right away and gave me something useful to do. I teamed up with another volunteer to set up several Trello boards to manage the many ongoing projects. Over the weekend I got connected to more warm, welcoming and encouraging people than I could ever imagine. Some of them noticed that I had a way of expressing myself that could point to a talent for speaking. They kept encouraging me to the point that I submitted my very first talk proposal. Looking back, I never really expected to be picked. You should have seen my face when I received the e-mail stating I had been selected&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Another leap of faith</h3>\n<p>So two months later, I was standing in front of some 50 people. At WordCamp Nijmegen, I shared my story about growing my self-confidence to a much healthier level by volunteering during WordCamps and other events. You can view the recording on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/10/14/yvette-sonneveld-voluntourism-how-being-a-wordcamp-volunteer-gets-you-places/\">WordPress.tv</a>. I received some great feedback. This gave me the confidence to apply for the next WordCamp, this time with a topic within my field of expertise: How to create buyer persona.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 2 years, one opportunity led to another: First, I became part of the organizing team of WordCamp Utrecht and helped organize that event twice. Then, I became a team rep for the #MakeWordPress marketing team. Next, I got to lead a workshop at WordCamp Europe 2018. And as a result of all of this, I landed several freelance gigs, training virtual assistants and writing copy for a renowned WordPress agency, Level Level. Ultimately, by making myself stretch my comfort zone a bit further out every single time, I ended up landing my dream job. I’m now in charge of marketing for Level Level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WCEU2018.jpg\"><img /></a>Contributing to WordPress will help you make friends from all over the world. I warmly recommend it!</p>\n<h3>Lessons learned along the way</h3>\n<p>Do I still have my moments of not feeling enough? Totally. But let me share some of the most valuable lessons I learned along the way.</p>\n<h4>People who were never bullied have the same insecurities</h4>\n<p>Ha, you didn’t see that one coming, right? And until you are ever ready to open up about your feelings of insecurity, others will probably not feel safe sharing their feelings about it, either. Because being vulnerable IS scary. And people may abuse it. But it can be amazingly empowering, too. Blaming the bullying and staying in my ever-shrinking comfort zone would probably have been easier, but I’m so happy I ended up discovering that it turned out I was telling myself a lie.</p>\n<h4>Your comfort zone is a muscle. It is made to stretch.</h4>\n<p>This has become one of my pet peeves. Work your comfort zone like a muscle. If you don’t, it will shrink right back. You’ll keep playing small. Stretching it will be painful at first. But imagine that feeling of victory, that intense satisfaction when you look back and notice how much you have grown. Needless to say, it takes quite a bit of energy. You will be exhausted at times, and your comfort zone muscles will be sore. It’s the circle of life, after all. You will survive and grow stronger every day, which is exactly what I want for you.</p>\n<h3>Find your kind of crazy</h3>\n<p>We WordPress people, as unique as we all are, have lots in common, too. When helping my son through a rough patch several years ago, I did a lot of online research. I took a deep dive into everything from ADD to giftedness, and from visual learning to being highly sensitive. The “symptoms” of all of these are very much alike. And the biggest lesson: if you’re able to focus for a long time on something that you really enjoy, it’s not ADD.  You may recognize some of these “symptoms”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not being able to sit still;</li>\n<li>easily distracted when working on routine matters;</li>\n<li>being able to hyperfocus when working on something that intrigues you;</li>\n<li>having a wide variety of interests;</li>\n<li>tend to get into power struggles with authoritative personalities;</li>\n<li>highly creative;</li>\n<li>mastering new skills by understanding and applying a concept rather than mastering it step by step (Once you know the concept of addition in math, for instance, it doesn’t matter whether you add 2+4 or 19574+274503. This in contrast to others who need to start with 1 digit numbers, then to 2 digit numbers etc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(see, <a href=\"https://www.sengifted.org/post/adhd-and-children-who-are-gifted\">https://www.sengifted.org/post/adhd-and-children-who-are-gifted</a> and <a href=\"https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10226\">https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10226</a> if you’d like to learn more about this.)</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, I had lots of conversations with community members, and have learned along the way that many recognize these. I think this is one of the reasons we feel so connected. But whether this sounds like you, or not at all…. I strongly recommend you to find and connect to a group of people that you resonate with and who love you for who YOU are. Encourage each other.</p>\n<h4>Be ruthless about self-care</h4>\n<p>I can see a huge difference in how I feel, both physically and mentally, depending on how well I take care of myself. Purely in simple things like eating lots of fruits and veggies. Drinking no-sugar drinks like herbal infusions and water. Getting enough sleep. Being out in nature. Exercising regularly. Hanging out with friends and family instead of working all the time. This by itself won’t get you out of a depression, but I am confident it will help improve things. It helps me from getting burned out, for sure.</p>\n<h3>If you’re employing one of us</h3>\n<p>You may be reading this and leading a team of WordPress people. And you may, or may not recognize yourself in parts of my story. Either way, I may have some valuable tips for you, too.</p>\n<h4>We’re precious. We’re valuable. And, we need more validation than average</h4>\n<p>We may not always notice that we’re burning the midnight oil. We may need you, or our co-workers to notice. We’re sprinters, not marathon runners. So we’ll have bouts of brilliance, and bouts where nothing may seem to come out of our hands. Know that. Appreciate that. And help us know that it’s ok that we’re wired like that. We may need that wee bit more of validation, of encouragement. We need to know you believe in us and that we’re valuable. And we may need a hug every once in a while.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\n<p>I’m not a psychologist. I’m just sharing what I what I learned while trying to turn my life around. Also, the highs and the lows keep coming and going. Over the past five years, though, the trend has been upwards. And getting through my lows has become easier as I have become more confident about my ability to get through.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right

<a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-to-acquire-flywheel/\">has announced</a> that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Managed WordPress host, <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Heather Brunner, WP Engine&#8217;s CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/wordpress-management-site-wp-engine-acquires-flywheel-as-it-moves-to-a-1b-valuation-and-ipo/\">confirmed to TechCrunch</a> that the company needed to raise a small round of funding to finance the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dusty Davidson, Tony Noecker, and Rick Knudtson founded Flywheel in 2012 in Omaha, Nebraska. In 2012, there were already a handful of players in the Managed WordPress Hosting space but Flywheel was able to carve out a niche by focusing on Designers and Agencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Flywheel became one of the few hosting companies added to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/hosting/\">WordPress.org recommended hosting</a> page. However, their listing was removed a few months later without an explanation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic\">Flywheel acquired Pressmatic</a>, a local WordPress development application for OS X from Clay Griffiths and rebranded it to Local by Flywheel. Representatives from both companies have stated that there are no plans to merge <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-launches-devkit-open-beta\">WP Engine Devkit</a> with Local by Flywheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a frequently asked questions document, nothing much is changing in the foreseeable future for Flywheel customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Business will continue as usual! There will be no immediate changes to the Flywheel platform, plans, or experience. We’ll be spending the coming weeks and months on strategic innovation and integration planning, and are super excited to figure out how we can leverage all of our collective strengths, products, and brand assets in the best possible way. </p><cite><a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/flywheel-is-joining-wpengine/\">Acquisition FAQ</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Flywheel has generated a loyal following of happy customers over the years and some of them took to Twitter to express their concerns regarding Monday&#8217;s announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please, please, please don\'t have this be the beginning of the end!

The Stories feature has its own post type that uses the block editor and comes with custom blocks that enable the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple story pages can be added in a horizontal editing interface</li>\n<li>Page reordering with drag and drop</li>\n<li>Text block (the default instead of Paragraph) allows for text to automatically resize to fit the container</li>\n<li>40 font families for styling the Text block</li>\n<li>Blocks can be dragged and rotated anywhere on a page, with ability to move in front of or behind other blocks</li>\n<li>Select from blank pages or pre-made page templates</li>\n<li>Text block can have varying background color opacity</li>\n<li>Blocks on a given page are listed in a persistent table of contents (with drag and drop)</li>\n<li>Story pages can have background video or image (with focal point)</li>\n<li>Pages can have a solid background color or gradient, including opacity for overlaying background image/video</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stories created in the editor can also be embedded in other posts and pages using the regular embed block or the Latest Stories block. </p>\n<p>Stories are a mobile-focused format that have become increasingly popular with social networking apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. Stories on these platforms are usually created as ephemeral bits of content that are not easy to embed without using a third-party application. Google is marketing AMP stories as &#8220;visual storytelling for the open web.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;I like to position it as Web Stories,&#8221; Google Developer Relations Program Manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweetythierry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thierry Muller</a> said. &#8220;It is powered by AMP, but there are none of the challenges developers might face when making a website AMP compatible. With Web Stories, users are now able to create stories accessible via a simple URL, content that they own and can use open source tools such as the Story editor for WordPress to create stories.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/washpo-amp-stories.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Muller said the target audience for AMP stories includes publishers, travel bloggers, food bloggers, and anyone who wants to create immersive content. Some well-known publishers, such as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/visual-stories/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/02/13/the-washington-post-launches-custom-story-presentation-with-googles-amp-stories/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>, and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/ampstories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a>, have partnered with Google as early adopters, using AMP stories to cover news and events. The Stories also show up in a carousel in mobile search results.</p>\n<p>WordPress users who want to start using the AMP plugin&#8217;s Stories feature will need to have Gutenberg 5.8+ installed, because it requires some of the newer features in the block editor that haven&#8217;t yet be merged into core. </p>\n<p>The addition of AMP Stories to the official AMP plugin may make it more appealing to those who have been hesitant to install it simply for the website capabilities. It gives the plugin another entry point with users who are more interested in the visual storytelling aspect. </p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/15357\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> examining the web standards community&#8217;s confusion surrounding how Google Chrome seemed to be unilaterally implementing a new element called toast, Jeremy Keith made a good observation regarding developers&#8217; skepticism about AMP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I certainly don’t think this is a good look for Google given the debacle of AMP’s &#8216;my way or the highway&#8217; rollout,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;I know that’s a completely different team, but the external perception of Google amongst developers has been damaged by the AMP project’s anti-competitive abuse of Google’s power in search.&#8221; Google Web Advocate Das Surma lent credibility to Keith&#8217;s take on the matter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1141627540282494977\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> it offered &#8220;a pretty accurate representation of our intentions, but also of the problems and mistakes we made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to quantitatively measure how developers&#8217; anti-AMP sentiment has affected the adoption of Google&#8217;s official AMP plugin for WordPress, especially given the rocky start it had in the official plugin directory. XWP and Google engineers had  a lot to overcome after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-for-wordpress-plugin-to-introduce-user-friendly-theme-support-settings-in-upcoming-1-0-release\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">taking over the plugin&#8217;s development</a> from Automattic when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-turns-2-automattic-partners-with-google-to-improve-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">users began to wonder if it had been abandoned</a>. </p>\n<p>The first version of the AMP plugin was released in October 2015 and initially had 400 active installs. Over the past four years, that number has grown to more than 400,000 active installs. The plugin has had a 33% increase in its user base from December 1, 2018 (300,000+) to today (400,00+). This is likely due to some of the more user-friendly improvements that have been introduced in the past six months. Google and XWP&#8217;s involvement seems to have successfully dug the plugin out of its previous trend towards negative ratings from users who couldn&#8217;t get any support. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Google is still struggling with the challenge to convince WordPress users that the AMP plugin is a must-have addition to their sites. Convincing the wider WordPress ecosystem to build <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/ecosystem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP-ready plugins and themes</a> that provide the compatibility for functionality that users&#8217; websites rely on in order to be anything more than a basic blog. Adding AMP stories to the plugin may help to get more WordPress users on board to further explore AMPing up their websites.</p>\n<p>Approximately 410/500 issues and pull requests in version 1.2 were dedicated to the new AMP Stories feature. This release introduces the notion of &#8220;AMP experiences,&#8221; a fancy industry buzz word that divides the Stories and Website features into separate functionality. The website framework improvements include a renaming of the template modes: Native, Paired, and Classic are now Standard, Transitional, and Reader, a strategic and notably less clear way of identifying the modes that seems intended to drive users towards adopting the native AMP approach. The editor has also been updated to display a warning when a featured image is too small for Google Search&#8217;s requirements, as well as provide better block-level warnings and improvements to validation requests.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2.0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">v1.2 changelog</a> for a full list of everything that is new in this release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 19:06:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2020 to be Held in Porto, June 4-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91060\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2020-to-be-held-in-porto-june-4-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12251:\"<p>Another successful edition of WordCamp Europe concluded this weekend in Berlin.

We also had an amazing line-up of speakers with 3 tracks and 3 workshops, along with on-time information shared to our attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2020 to be Held in Porto, Portugal</h3>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, organizers announced that next year WCEU is coming to Porto, June 4-6. Porto is Portugal&#8217;s second largest city, known for its beautiful beaches, port wine exports, bridges, vineyards, charming cobblestone streets, and affordability. It also has a vibrant and growing WordPress community. Portugal is home to <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2015/07/09/ze-fontainhas-how-wordcamp-europe-came-to-be/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zé Fontainhas</a>, one of the original creators of WordCamp Europe. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/josefreitas2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jose Freitas</a>, who will be heading up the local team in Portugal, has been working with WordPress since 2008 and has been involved with the community since 2013. He said the Portuguese WordPress community has been working on its application to host WCEU for three years. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have WCEU in Porto next year,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;Portugal is indeed a small country but we have a good WordPress community. At Porto we have had a monthly WordPress Meetup since January 2014, without failing a month. WordPress is growing quickly in Portugal and every day we have people joining our community.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The greater community is connected on Facebook through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpportugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Portugal</a> group, which has more than 4,400 members.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We found that for some people, mostly beginners, it’s difficult to start using the support forums,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;So we made a Facebook group and people can ask questions and receive help or feedback related to their projects. Most of the users are people that made their own websites and websites for non profit organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Up until now, Portugal has hosted one WordCamp per year, alternating between Porto and Lisbon locations. Following 2020, local organizers plan to host two camps per year, and WC Lisboa is expected to be scheduled for October 2020.</p>\n<p>The Porto community had formidable competition in its journey to securing the opportunity to host WCEU 2020, beating out Athens, Granada, Manchester, and Torino. Freitas attributes his team&#8217;s success to its dedication to improving Porto&#8217;s application for the past three years, following a disappointing attempt in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First it was only a dream,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;After, it was <em>what if…</em> We applied the first time in 2016 to WCEU 2017. We were in the final decision but the event went to Paris, as we all know. So we started right then the application to 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made it better, stronger, complete with all the new requirements. Each WCEU was getting something new and in each one we added the new thing to our documentation. We made a strict budget, with realistic numbers in all parameters. I think that was important for the people who made the selection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WCEU 2020 sessions will be held in English. Freitas said the majority of Portuguese people have a good understanding of English and most in the WordPress community are fluent in both languages. </p>\n<p>The maximum capacity for the venue is 8,000 people. WCEU&#8217;s arrangement for 2020 allows attendance to go up to 4,000, in case the event has another record-breaking year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a wonderful venue in the city center and surrounded by a garden and a balcony with amazing views of the river and part of the city,&#8221; Freitas said.</p>\n<p>WCEU 2019 local lead Bernhard Kau will be joining the 2020 team as one of the global leads to provide a smooth transition from one year to the next. Attendees can expect some of the successful aspects of the 2019 event to make a return at next year&#8217;s WCEU.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The additions of WP Cafe and Wellness at WCEU were a big success and I would love to have more space for them at WordCamp Europe 2020 in Porto,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;There are also some other ideas helping attendees staying healthy, both physically and mentally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I have never been to Portugal, I am very excited to visit another country. I have met some members of the Portuguese Community on WordCamps throughout Europe and they are some of the most friendly people you can find.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For those who are considering adding WCEU 2020 in Porto to their calendars, Freitas offered a preview of what attendees can expect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine yourself… it is June, 3, 2020. There’s one day to go before WCEU.</p>\n<p>You go to the city center to know a little of the city. You walk in small and narrow streets and find that some of those have a history of more that a thousand years. You ask some directions, because you don’t want to use smartphone maps, and people are nice and even offer to take you to the place that is only 500 meters way.</p>\n<p>You go to the very old part of the city and realize that it wasn’t changed for many, many years. It was not changed because people didn’t want to and because now it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>\n<p>You sit near the river and look at the bridge designed and build by a student of Eiffel (yep, that Eiffel). The sun has made the Douro river look like silver and you finally get why the Romans gave the name of Porto (port) to the place.</p>\n<p>It’s time to lunch some tasty and delightful Portuguese food. Don’t skip the dessert. To burn some calories you’ll go to the check the venue.</p>\n<p>You pass the old Reitoria building (the place were the university principal used to work) &#8211; Porto has the biggest Portuguese university &#8211; and see a garden with trees, flowers and even some peacocks.</p>\n<p>You enter there and find the way to the venue: it looks like the top of a spaceship, like the ones in the movies. There’s a banner: &#8220;WordCamp Europe 2020.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now you feel that you’re only a few hours away from the moment you have been waiting for. But, let’s go because you have to see other parts of the city.</p>\n<p>The next day, you join hundreds of WordPress people who are helping the community in Contributor Day. There is a lot to do before the two conference days and workshops, before visiting the sponsors area, before meeting some of the nice folks that you didn’t see since last year, before making new friends.</p>\n<p>After all, it’s possible to make new friends in an event of thousands of people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is made possible every year by a massive team of organizers and volunteers who help keep costs low, in addition to sponsors. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The organising team would like to thank all of the volunteers for contributing to an amazing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/1um7usNZqT\">pic.twitter.com/1um7usNZqT</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Europe (@WCEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1142455860683333632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 2020 team put out the <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">call for organizers</a> after announcing the host city.

This section contains fields that enable users to share how much time they contribute to WordPress on a weekly basis, which teams they contribute to, and whether or not those contributions are sponsored. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />New WordPress.org User Profile Fields</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each field is optional and will only appear if the Hours and Teams fields are filled in. The sponsored tag will only appear next to the Contributions heading if you answer Yes to being sponsored and the other fields are filled in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Middleton describes these fields as a step towards a possible version one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2018/11/05/proposal-five-for-the-future-acknowledgement-page/\">Five for the Future program</a> that was published last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it will also help with transparency, and might facilitate how teams set internal expectations for how much time different contributors might have to spend on a project or ongoing task,&#8221; she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the profile fields, the official <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">WordPress Jobs Board</a> has also been updated to include a new <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/job_category/contributor/\">Contributor position</a>. The goal is to make it easier for companies to find and hire people interested in becoming sponsored contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are the first iteration with plans to enhance them in the future.

He attributed much of its continued success to the availability of the Gutenberg plugin, which allows for quick iteration and testing. More than 150,000 posts are published per day using the block editor, which Mullenweg said is &#8220;a testament to the long development period&#8221; that gave the team an opportunity to work out bugs and make it usable for a large number of people.</p>\n<p>Since its initial release, the block editor has added a host of notable improvements, including block management capabilities, a cover block with nested elements, widgets as blocks, block grouping, and snackbar style notices. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted a few beautiful and innovative examples of Gutenberg in the wild. Two projects from <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Human Made</a> showcase Gutenberg-powered designs (<a href=\"https://www.artefactgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">artefactgroup.com</a>) and an AI integration that analyzes a user&#8217;s writing in the editor (<a href=\"https://ingenuity.siemens.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ingenuity.siemens.com</a>.) </p>\n<p>Election season is ramping up in the U.S. and Gutenberg-powered sites, like <a href=\"https://hurst4delegate.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hurst4delegate.com</a>, are starting to pop up. Mullenweg noted that 21/24 of the current democratic candidates for President are using WordPress for their sites. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Whitehouse.gov</a> also switched from Drupal to WordPress earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg also gave a quick preview of some of the upcoming Gutenberg features that are currently being developed on GitHub. Most of them are still in the prototype stage. The team is creating a system to install new blocks online, which will tie into the planned block directory. Mullenweg said Blocks could become a new top-level menu item in the WordPress admin, with screens dedicated to block discovery. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"A block directory is coming that will take over other “top level navigation” and brings a “playfulness” to discovering <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> blocks.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wsiHcPaVuL\">pic.twitter.com/wsiHcPaVuL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1142044607800369153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>He showed demos of the navigation block in progress, a prototype for adding realistic motion to block movement, an experimental footnotes block, and a demo of resizing images with &#8220;snap to grid&#8221; capabilities. Mullenweg said one of the goals with Gutenberg is to &#8220;make it possible to create beautiful experiences, because that’s part of what the web needs to win.” </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New footnotes feature being tested in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/b8yhn2X71w\">pic.twitter.com/b8yhn2X71w</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1142045330969640961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mullenweg also gave an update on Gutenberg&#8217;s progress in the mobile apps. He said the new editor is operational but development is slow moving because the mobile engineers essentially have to duplicate all of the work that has been done by hundreds of Gutenberg contributors thus far. </p>\n<h3>Q&#038;A Highlights Governance, Core Maintenance, and the Future of WordPress Themes</h3>\n<p>The Q&#038;A portion of the session featured a variety of topics, ranging from an aggressive tirade about licensing and Envato, to more relevant inquiries about the future of WordPress themes. While this format of interaction has its shortcomings, it gives community members the opportunity to check on the status of issues where they have a particular interest. </p>\n<p>One attendee asked if WordPress.org plans to implement a more democratic structure for decision making. Mullenweg seemed to interpret the question as referencing a system where tens or hundreds of millions of WordPress users would participate in making decisions on features through a vote or some other form of feedback. In contrast, he said WordPress&#8217; current approach is for leadership to try to get a sense for what the most common issues are through polls and public channels and allow those issues to help shape the project&#8217;s roadmap. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg shared that one particular issue on his mind right now is the problem of &#8220;how do I make my theme look like the demo?&#8221; He said contributors are experimenting with different types of models for making decisions that move WordPress in the direction to solve these types of problems. </p>\n<p>He said that the project&#8217;s decision making is fairly transparent, without a lot of mystery, and that the community has tons of feedback mechanisms. This is a somewhat controversial claim, as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/04/26/5-0-release-retrospective-wrap-up/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regular project contributors have expressed frustration with the lack of communication</a> surrounding important planning and decisions, such as release dates and project timing, as it pertained to how WordPress 5.0 landed. The community was frustrated by a lack of effective ways to communicate critical issues and complaints to project leadership. As a followup to this specific feedback, Josepha Haden, the new Executive Director of the WordPress project, has been diligent to track and communicate how leadership is working to improve communication.</p>\n<p>Another attendee asked if WordPress themes will become obsolete after Gutenberg gains more site-building capabilities. Mullenweg predicted they will always be a part of WordPress but seemed inclined to let the market decide the fate of themes.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are going to change for sure. I don’t think they ever go away.” He said he could see developers offering an array of different designs that could be used as a starting point. Although a WordPress theme has a very specific definition right now (as far as what types of files are included), Mullenweg said he can see that  definition evolving over time. He said he could see themes becoming like a starter template or a library of patterns to choose from, or even a set of complex layouts that could work across different themes. </p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to decouple themes a little bit but I don’t know how or what that will look like,” Mullwenweg said. He also noted that a lot of themes right now represent a similar aesthetic, often business minimalist that use white and blue colors. Design trends have the potential to shift dramatically as Gutenberg and themes evolve to allow users more control over how their sites are designed.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the WordPress development community is eager to switch to GitHub or another Git-based infrastructure for core development. Most of the recent feature projects have successfully matured on GitHub, with the majority of work and discussion taking place outside of Trac. One attendee asked about the possibility of moving away from Trac in the near future. Mullenweg said that this year the team that works on WordPress.org is prioritizing changes to the directory, but in the meantime anyone with Python knowledge is welcome to contribute to tweaking Trac for improvements in the interim before WordPress moves to Git-based development.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’d love to move off of Trac as much as the next person. In the interim I’m working some cool tools to make life easier using the Elasticsearch cluster I built for it. Let me know if you want to help! <a href=\"https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ\">https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; William Earnhardt (@earnjam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/earnjam/status/1142057095044444160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response to a question about blockchain technology and WordPress, Mullenweg said he has long been an enthusiast in this area and loves the idea of open source applying to money, as well as having a distributed ledger. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But I can’t think of any problem in core WordPress right now that the overhead of a blockchain would really improve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything I could think of right now would probably be plugin territory.&#8221; However, he said that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordproof-plugin-timestamps-wordpress-content-on-the-blockchain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof plugin&#8217;s timestamping WordPress content</a> on the blockchain is among one of the best ideas he has seen for this technology so far.</p>\n<p>When asked how he plans to &#8220;balance chasing the new and shiny with all of WordPress&#8217; existing legacy APIs,&#8221; Mullenweg said that &#8220;PHP is going to be crucial to us for many years to come.&#8221; He recognized that the project has fallen behind in maintenance with some of its older APIs but that work on Gutenberg can be done in parallel. </p>\n<p>The new triage team is currently going through all the tickets, refreshing patches, and working on taking them to resolution. Mullenweg noted that WordCamp Europe hosted the first ever triage table at its contributor day and said that this new area is ripe for contribution.</p>\n<p>The REST API, despite its broad support and noteworthy contributors, is one area that Mullenweg said has held Gutenberg back. He said it still does not have the demonstrated use that its advocates predicted when working to get it merged into core and cautioned that WordPress should always use an API first before shipping it to the world.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the Q&#038;A by estimating that Gutenberg is only 10% of the way down the road towards solving the problems that WordPress contributors set out to tackle. He predicts that building on this initial effort will carry into the next decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:48:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Free Event: Post Status to Live Stream Publish Online July 8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/free-event-post-status-to-live-stream-publish-online-july-8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1674:\"<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a> will be live streaming <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Publish Online</a> on July 8-9, 2019.

It is used by tens of thousands of developers and downloaded nearly 500,000 times each month.</p>\n<p>Gatsby founder Kyle Mathews created <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby Inc</a>. as a company to further the project&#8217;s goals, and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">received $3.8M in seed funding</a> in May 2018. The investment is being used to build cloud services for Gatsby and improve Gatsby&#8217;s core open source software. As the company has grown, Gatsby is beginning to invest more heavily in the open source ecosystem that surrounds the project.</p>\n<p>With WordPress powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">34% of the top 10 million websites</a>, it&#8217;s only natural that Gatsby would look to WPGraphQL, one of the most promising projects in the WP ecosystem, for its next investment in open source. The more WordPress developers Gatsby can get using GraphQL and JavaScript, the more it benefits the greater Gatsby ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of developers using Gatsby to build sites where the content is managed by WordPress is growing,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;The current `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin pulls data into Gatsby using the WordPress REST API, but the REST API has a lot of pain points that are proving to be very difficult to get past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL solves many of those pain points already, and has potential to solve even more. The more robust WPGraphQL is, the better it is for all JavaScript consumers, whether it be Next.js, Gridsome (a Vue static site generator) or Gatsby.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl followed the Gatsby project from afar before striking up a relationship with the team through the various Slack channels where the community is active. A year and a half ago, he moved the <a href=\"http://docs.wpgraphql.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">docs.wpgraphql.com</a> site from WordPress to Gatsby, where the content is stored in Markdown files on Github. This allows users in the community to contribute to the docs by submitting pull requests.</p>\n<p>In February 2019, Bahl gave a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/03/08/jason-bahl-building-static-sites-with-wordpress-gatsby-and-wpgraphql/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building Static Sites with WordPress, Gatsby and WPGraphQL</a>&#8221; After that he saw more growth in the  crossover ecosystems &#8211; more people in the Gatsby Slack asking about WordPress, and more developers in the WPGraphQL Slack asking about Gatsby.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been following all things GraphQL for a few years, so Gatsby has been on my radar for a while as Gatsby uses GraphQL to create a &#8216;content mesh&#8217; where data can be pulled from many sources into one Gatsby site,&#8221; Bahl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The more I followed Gatsby from afar, the more intrigued I was. The development experience of Gatsby is great, especially if you enjoy React, which I do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl is active in both Slacks, on both GitHub repos, and on Twitter, helping people build Gatsby sites with WordPress and GraphQL, which is how he developed a relationship with the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In mid April I made it known to a few people that I would love to work on WPGraphQL full-time if I had the opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On May 30, Kyle Matthews direct messaged me on Twitter saying Gatsby is planning on investing in WordPress more and they&#8217;d love to chat. The following week I had some video calls with Kyle, Sam, and some other folks on the Gatsby team, and they made me a formal offer to join the Gatsby teams to make WPGraphQL the best it can be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WPGraphQL project already has a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpgraphql-project-gains-momentum-with-growing-library-of-extensions-for-popular-wordpress-projects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rapidly growing library of extensions</a> for popular WordPress plugins, despite the fact that the project has not yet reached a stable 1.0 release. Bahl&#8217;s new opportunity with the Gatsby team will enable him to work with the community&#8217;s momentum to get WPGraphQL further on its roadmap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working on WPGraphQL full time will allow me to work on features and bugs that I’ve not had adequate time to focus on while also maintaining a full time job,&#8221; Bahl said.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL is used in production by many already, but it’s still pre 1.0 because of some breaking changes I foresee but haven’t had adequate time to dedicate to addressing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl will also be available to provide better resources for the community, such as documentation, example codebases, and courses and tutorials, in addition to attending more WordCamps and other conferences, participating in podcasts, and interacting on GitHub issues, Slack, and other communication channels.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;It will also provide more time to focus on conversations on whether GraphQL should be part of WordPress core (or not), and educate the community and core maintainers on the tradeoffs,&#8221; Bahl said. </p>\n<p>In hiring Bahl to work on WPGraphQL, Gatsby is making a significant investment in the WordPress community that depends on this project. The improved support and quicker pace of development should bring peace of mind to those who are already using WPGraphQL in production. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ll also be working closely with other members of the Gatsby team to make the experience of using Gatsby with WordPress a great experience,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We have a lot of ideas about how WPGraphQL can make the Gatsby + WordPress experience a fantastic one for developers and users alike.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 19:52:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce.com Clarifies Its Policy on Selling CBD Products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90955\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-com-clarifies-its-policy-on-selling-cbd-products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6948:\"<p>Last week, a member of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/woohelp/\">WooCommerce Help and Share Facebook</a> group who sells Cannabidiol or CBD products submitted a post that included an email exchange with WooCommerce support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the exchange, the support rep explained to the store owner that when their WooCommerce.com account was connected to a WordPress.com login, it then fell under the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/store-guidelines/\">WordPress.com store guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the guidelines, controlled substances (including marijuana, cannabidiol or CBD, and other cannabis-derived products) are not allowed to be sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep goes on to say that this included but was not limited to sites using WordPress.com, the Jetpack plugin, and any extensions from WooCommerce.com.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The store owner is then informed that their store will be disconnected from Automattic hosted services if they continue to sell CBD products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Legal Document Becomes a Source of Confusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep provided the store owner with a link to the most <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-cbd/\">frequently asked questions</a> on selling CBD products using WooCommerce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording of the document made it seem as though there was a difference between downloading the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory or WooCommerce.com. It also appeared to apply limits on how the GPL licensed software could be used. Here is a cached version of the original document. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Can WooCommerce be used to sell cannabis-derived products such as CBD oil? </strong></p><p><strong>Yes</strong>, if you download the WooCommerce plugin directly from WordPress.org or install the WooCommerce plugin via the Plugins page of your site from WordPress.org.</p><p><strong>No</strong>, if you download and install the WooCommerce plugin directly from WooCommerce.com.</p><p>It is the same WooCommerce plugin, but the location of download makes a difference?<strong><br />What’s the difference?</strong> <br />The difference is ownership.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WordPress.org</strong> is open-source software and is hosted through a third-party company.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WooCommerce.com and WordPress.com</strong> is hosted through Automattic.

As our software is open source, we do not limit its use. </p><p>However, while you can use the code of our WooCommerce plugin to sell products derived from cannabis and hemp, you cannot use <strong>services</strong> offered directly by Automattic to support those stores.

You might also receive help from others in the WordPress.org  forums or the WooCommerce community.</p><cite>Revised WooCommerce and CBD Products FAQ</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two years, WooCommerce has increasingly relied on Jetpack and its connection to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure to provide services. These include <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/\">WooCommerce Shipping</a>, the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/mobile/\">WooCommerce app</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.taxjar.com/woocommerce-services-automated-tax-calculations-powered-taxjar/\">Automated Tax Calculations</a>. In 2017, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/wooconf-state-of-the-woo/\">Todd Wilkens made it clear</a> that WooCommerce would continue to make extensive use of Jetpack to provide cloud services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the policy makes things clearer, CBD store owners will need to determine if they can live without the conveniences provided by Jetpack, WooCommerce.com, and WordPress.com. This situation is also a reminder to all store owners to double check a service&#8217;s policies before connecting any sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated on June 25th, 2019. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1143590019849949184\">updated its policy</a> to allow automatic updates from WooCommerce.com </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 01:02:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Watch the Free WordCamp Europe 2019 Live Stream June 21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90487\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-the-free-wordcamp-europe-2019-live-stream-june-21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2026:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2019</a> kicks off tomorrow, June 20, with Contributor Day.

It provides a dashboard that displays how well a site is doing with various Google tools, such as Search Console, Analytics, AdSense, and PageSpeed Insights, packaged as a one-stop solution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-19-at-4.08.49-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The developer preview announced today includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless site verification with Search Console</li>\n<li>Provisioning and configuration of Analytics, AdSense, Tag Manager and Optimize</li>\n<li>Simple aggregate and per-page reporting from Search Console, Analytics, and AdSense, to help you understand the full acquisition and monetization funnel</li>\n<li>Continuous site performance auditing and monitoring with PageSpeed Insights</li>\n<li>Insights we derive from across the products you’ve connected and surface on your dashboard, to help you make sense of the stats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Site Kit will give WordPress users access to information and stats from Google tools directly inside the dashboard. Instead of having to log into multiple Google services to hunt down site performance and page traffic information, this plugin aggregates the most data and puts it at your fingertips inside the WordPress admin where it is most relevant. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/site-kit-admin-bar-page-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Site Kit plugin is still under active development on <a href=\"https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and beta testers will need to be familiar with the Google Cloud Platform and OAuth in order to get started. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-19-at-5.00.56-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The setup experience is not user-friendly but rather geared towards getting feedback on the plugin&#8217;s current features. Google isn&#8217;t planning on putting Site Kit on WordPress.org until the setup process has been improved to be a better experience for WordPress users who are not developers. The goals for the developer beta are to gather feedback on the plugin&#8217;s functionality and compatibility with other plugins. </p>\n<p>A contingency of engineers from Google&#8217;s Developer Programs team will be available at the Google booth during WordCamp Europe to answer questions from the community on Site Kit and any of the company&#8217;s other products.

You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for Cataract Surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision.

It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens.

The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

Normally, fluid in eye flows from behind pupil to a place between the iris and cornea, which is known as the angle of the eyes. This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age. In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advancements in contact lenses. Contact lenses enable people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions to enjoy normal vision. These conditions include:</p>\r\n					<p><ul>\r\n						<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n						<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n						<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n					</ul></p>\r\n					<p>Infants and young children often suffer from various visual conditions, and contact lenses can help ensure that their vision system develops normally.

In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that is in closer proximity to the normal eye. This is important as it provides your child the best chance to develop good vision. Several parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high.

Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.

A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.</p>\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n						<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n						<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Causes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Hyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>A family history of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Hyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Hyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>Astigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n						<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n						<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Causes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n					</p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>Presbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. It is the normal aging process of the lens, however, it can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Objects located nearby appear blurred</li>\r\n						<li>Difficulty in seeing objects located nearby</li></ul>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia.

However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Causes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>The cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Genetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>The signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n					<div class=\"\"><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></div>\r\n\r\n					<p>Although there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus. When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant is likely to be recommended.In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea. Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and is likely to slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.</p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n'),(2608,121,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2609,431,'home_image','169'),(2610,431,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2611,431,'page_content',''),(2612,431,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2613,123,'page_content','<div class=\"common-wrapper clear-both\">\r\n	<div class=\"row\">\r\n		<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n			<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Contact Lens Service<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n					<p>\r\n					Each attack can be treated depending upon the cause, location and severity of the inflammation.

You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection).

The cataract is then sucked out of the eye.

Normally, fluid in eye flows from behind pupil to a place between the iris and cornea, which is known as the angle of the eyes. This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age. In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually. Hence, relatives of patients diagnosed with OAG are advised to undergo regular eye check-ups, which enables the early detection of the condition and helps prevent its progression to blindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Closed-Angle Glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis condition is usually detected when a patient experiences pain and rapid vision loss.

People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n						<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n						<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs &amp; Symptoms of Cataract <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">A cataract starts out small, and at first, has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for cataract surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions.

It did not seem to be a major problem initially, however, as she grew older, it her squint continued to increase, and started aﬀecting her vision. It started aﬀecting her ability to study. Nikita’s mother wanted to treat her, but was unable to do so because of ﬁnancial issues as well as issues related to her own health. In addition, Nikita’s squint not only aﬀected her studies, but also her social life. Despite their ﬁnancial issues, Nikita’s old parents planned her surgery, however, it had to be postponed as she caught a cold.</p> \r\n\r\n				<p>Shortly afterwards, H.V. Desai Eye Hospital organised a camp at Nikita’s school, following which she was referred to H.V. Desai Eye Hospital for detail screening. After the screening it was recommended for her to undergo Squint Vertical. Few days later, she underwent surgery free of cost with the help of SBI life insurance. She was very happy when she came for her follow-up. And her mother was very satisﬁed with the result. Nikita and her mother are extremely grateful towards SBI Life and H.V.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advancements in contact lenses. Contact lenses enable people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions to enjoy normal vision. These conditions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often suffer from various visual conditions, and contact lenses can help ensure that their vision system develops normally. At H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we offer various types of contact lens, which include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic lenses (to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialised keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a major eye hospital, the contact lens services at PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attract participants nationwide.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lenses for Children</strong>\r\n\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or do not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that is in closer proximity to the normal eye. This is important as it provides your child the best chance to develop good vision. Several parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. In addition, we educate parents about taking appropriate care of their child’s contact lenses to avoid potential problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen the contact lenses are dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove them, as well as how to care for the lens when it is not in the child\'s eye. Patients wearing extended-wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</strong>\r\n\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, the vision is appropriate, and that no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Myopia (Near-sightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly. People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina. This often occurs if an eyeball is longer than average.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA history of myopia is among the major risk factors for myopia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are also highly associated with myopia.  Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor that is likely to cause myopia later in life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.

A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA family history of hyperopia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. It is the normal aging process of the lens, however, it can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Objects located nearby appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty in seeing objects located nearby</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal whether you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Keratoconus?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause the distortion of visual images.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nThe cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nThe signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus.

People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina. This often occurs if an eyeball is longer than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A history of myopia is among the major risk factors for myopia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are also highly associated with myopia.  Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor that is likely to cause myopia later in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Hyperopia (Farsightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A family history of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Astigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. It is the normal aging process of the lens, however, it can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Objects located nearby appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty in seeing objects located nearby</li></ul>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.</strong>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal whether you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Keratoconus?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Keratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause the distortion of visual images.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus. When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant is likely to be recommended.In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea. Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and is likely to slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),(2905,494,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2906,496,'home_image','167'),(2907,496,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2908,496,'page_content',''),(2909,496,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2910,497,'home_image','167'),(2911,497,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2912,497,'page_content',''),(2913,497,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2914,499,'home_image','162'),(2915,499,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2916,499,'page_content','<div class=\"common-wrapper clear-both\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Schwind Combi Wavefront Analyser<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\nH.V.

transmits light to the nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via the optic nerve for the perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Facilities available at H.V. Desai Hospital are:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Investigations</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination: Advanced high-resolution imaging technology for the consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity and conduct a detailed evaluation without the long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal for the use of such advanced technology</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography: To view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography: To view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non-perfused areas of the retina</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography: To view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography: For the detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography: To evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography: To graphically represent the functional capacity of the retinal cells</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential: For the measurement of the electrical activity of the visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Medical Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours and retinopathy of prematurity, among others, which are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by an indirect ophthalmoscope. Lasers available at the hospital include diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used for the treatment of tumours. They damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to the normal retina</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used for the treatment of conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease that causes ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Moreover, intravitreal steroids can be used for the effective treatment of macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used for the treatment of grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Vitreo-retinal surgery <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\"><p>Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly at H.V.

Normally, fluid in eye flows from behind pupil to a place between the iris and cornea, which is known as the angle of the eyes. This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age. In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually. Hence, relatives of patients diagnosed with OAG are advised to undergo regular eye check-ups, which enables the early detection of the condition and helps prevent its progression to blindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Closed-Angle Glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis condition is usually detected when a patient experiences pain and rapid vision loss. Fortunately, permanent damage is uncommon due to this condition as patients normally seek immediate medical help for these symptoms, which leads to prompt diagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs and symptoms of closed-angle glaucoma <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Eye pain, usually severe</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Eye pain is often accompanied by nausea and sometimes vomiting</li>\r\n 	<li>Lights appear to have extra halo-like glows around them</li>\r\n 	<li>Red eyes</li>\r\n 	<li>Sudden and unexpected loss of vision, especially in dim light</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOther types of glaucoma: traumatic glaucoma, congenital glaucoma, drug-induced glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, etc.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Who are at the High Risk of Suffering from Glaucoma? <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nMost often, glaucoma occurs in adults aged over 40 years, however, it can also occur in young adults, children, and infants.

It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully.

It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance.

However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions.

One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for Cataract Surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision.

Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n						<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs &amp; Symptoms of Cataract <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">A cataract starts out small, and at first, has little effect on your vision.

It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for Cataract Surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advancements in contact lenses. Contact lenses enable people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions to enjoy normal vision. These conditions include:</p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>Infants and young children often suffer from various visual conditions, and contact lenses can help ensure that their vision system develops normally. At H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we offer various types of contact lens, which include:</p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic lenses (to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialised keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>As a major eye hospital, the contact lens services at PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attract participants nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Contact Lenses for Children</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or do not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that is in closer proximity to the normal eye. This is important as it provides your child the best chance to develop good vision. Several parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. In addition, we educate parents about taking appropriate care of their child’s contact lenses to avoid potential problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the contact lenses are dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove them, as well as how to care for the lens when it is not in the child\'s eye. Patients wearing extended-wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Follow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, the vision is appropriate, and that no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Myopia (Near-sightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly. People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina. This often occurs if an eyeball is longer than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A history of myopia is among the major risk factors for myopia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are also highly associated with myopia.  Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor that is likely to cause myopia later in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Hyperopia (Farsightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A family history of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Astigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. It is the normal aging process of the lens, however, it can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Objects located nearby appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty in seeing objects located nearby</li></ul>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia.

This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause the distortion of visual images.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus. When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant is likely to be recommended.In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea. Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and is likely to slow the progression of keratoconus.

Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Causes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now.

Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>\r\n				<p><ul>\r\n					<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n					<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n					<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n				</ul></p>\r\n				<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"\"><strong>Causes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n				<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"\"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></div>\r\n\r\n				<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"\"><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></div>\r\n\r\n				<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"\"><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></div>\r\n\r\n				<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now.

At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','A speciality clinic of H.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

Now the world’s largest eye care complex, Aravind served 4.7 million outpatients and performed more than 463,000 surgeries and laser procedures in the 2016-17 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nOn Litwin’s first trip to India, Venkataswamy took him to an eye camp in Pondicherry. One thousand people received cataract surgery over the course of a week.\r\n\r\n“I was converted,” Litwin reminisced. “I realized something magical was going on. If one patient is static like a bird on a branch, an eye camp is different; more like a flock of birds sweeping across the sky.”\r\n\r\nOn that inaugural trip, Litwin introduced Aravind to the newly-developed technology of intra-ocular lenses. IOLs revolutionized cataract surgery. With Seva’s support, the Aravind system established in-country IOL manufacturing, bringing the cost down to the point where cataract surgery is so affordable that no one is turned away for lack of funds.\r\n\r\n“The Aravind eye care system is fulfilling Dr. V’s vision of solving blindness,” said Litwin. “There has been someone on Seva’s Board of Directors from the Aravind system from the beginning. They help us, they teach us, and we work collaboratively on projects.”\r\n\r\nOn his most recent trip, Litwin visited Pune for the first time, to meet with the top brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital. HV Desai is involved in a Seva initiative to establish Vision Centers, “small optical shops in remote areas where there are no eye hospitals and tremendous numbers of blind people,” explained Litwin. Trained staff at these centers can prescribe glasses, treat diseases with antibiotics and take cell-phone photos of more complex problems to send to an eye hospital for diagnosis. The centers arrange transportation to the hospital for patients needing surgery. “We hope to reach a billion people through this approach,” Litwin said.\r\n\r\nDr. Colonel M. Deshpande at HV Desai, who worked with Venkataswamy, shared with Litwin that vision centers suffered from high staff turnover due to their remote locations. In response, a new system was devised where the centers started operating once a week on Market Day, at a central location like a religious institution.\r\n\r\nPeople now know that they attend to their eye care needs on Market Day. Litwin will share this and other creative solutions with staff at Seva, who work with eye care providers in more than 20 countries.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\nSeva is able to use insights like these from Litwin’s trips to India to inform their work in other countries facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins have formed several lifelong friendships with Indian colleagues over the years. On this most recent trip, they visited Dr. Asim Sil and his wife, Dr. Subhra Sil, at Vivekananda Mission Ashram Netra Niramay Niketan eye hospital, near Kolkata.\r\n\r\nThey’ve known Asim and Suhbra for 12 years, and Litwin has worked with them on earlier projects, like establishing a corneal transplant program. They now vacation regularly together, including a recent river trip in the Sundarbans, an area that sends patients to one of the two eye hospitals Seva supports in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Aravind Eye Care System sets the gold standard for eye care in India. The system’s latest branch hospital, which just opened in Chennai a few months ago, has the capacity to treat 6,000 patients daily. This new hospital is being run by Dr. S. Aravind – who was 12 years old when Dick and Judith first met him – and his wife, Dr. Haripriya, a dynamic cataract surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins’ many volunteer visits and personal relationships have grown Seva’s partnership network in India to include 60 partner eye care institutions based in 17 Indian states.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advances in contact lenses. Contact lenses allow normal vision for people with a wide range of medical conditions. This includes patient who have:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often have various visual conditions that require a contact lens so that their vision system can develop normally.

V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. The state-of-the-art facilities available at PBMA’s H.V Desai Eye Hospital include High end Biometry &amp; Operative Planning modules; Phacoemulsification systems &amp; Operating Microscopes which enable us to perform Phacoemulsification (Micro incision suture less surgery) and Small Incision Cataract surgery.\r\n<h2>Facilities for cataract surgery</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag Streit Lenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n 	<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions.

LASIK helps in the treatment of a wide range of refractive errors such as Myopia (nearsightedness), hypermetropia (farsightedness) and astigmatism.\r\n\r\nAt H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we believe in helping people get rid of their glasses and educating them about LASIK surgery. For those who are found to be unfit for LASIK, we provide PRK.\r\nThe availability of the latest technologically advanced diagnostic equipment and laser technology has enabled us to provide better, safer and predictable outcomes. Wavefront-guided LASIK is among the most preferred methods for vision correction worldwide. With its excellent safety profile, patient comfort and superior visual outcomes, wavefront-guided laser platforms provide the best image quality with a clearer vision. The entire vision correction procedure takes less than 15 minutes, and patients are able to resume their day-to-day activities the very next day.\r\n\r\nH.V.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underwe','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-10 11:30:28','2019-06-10 11:30:28','',74,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/06/10/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(421,1,'2019-06-10 11:40:09','2019-06-10 11:40:09','<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception in the year 2000, PBMA’s&nbsp;H.V.

Desai Eye Hospital specialises in dealing with all types of glaucoma, including primary, secondary, paediatric and end-stage glaucoma. At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

V. Desai Eye Hospital evaluate and fit contact lenses that correct for near-sightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. Our optometrists also can recommend new options in soft and rigid lenses for presbyopia. Contact lenses also have therapeutic uses, and contacts for a medical diagnosis are prescribed as well. Some examples include contacts following injury or corneal transplantation, contacts with artificial iris, and contacts for eye conditions such as keratoconus and Aphakia.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Service</h2>\r\nThe Contact Lens Service evaluates and fits patients of all ages using the latest in contact lens technology and information, often before it has even been introduced in the general eye practitioner\'s office. The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advances in contact lenses. Contact lenses allow normal vision for people with a wide range of medical conditions. This includes patient who have:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often have various visual conditions that require a contact lens so that their vision system can develop normally. We offer every type of contact lens, including:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic Lenses ( to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialized keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a major eye hospital, PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

At times , a depot steroid injection is used which causes slow release of drug into the eye .The drug usually lasts for several weeks and close monitoring of such patients is required with regular follow ups.\r\n\r\nUveitis with glaucoma, uveitis with vitreoretinal complications are handled in close cooperation with specialized Consultants in the respective fields.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is well equipped with modern machines, instruments and facilities fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, Indocyanin green angiography, ultrasonography, ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography.\r\n\r\nThe Department has taken up many research projects in this section :\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A Phase 3 trial-Controlled ,Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye.</li>\r\n 	<li>PEACHTREE:A Phase 3 trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension for the Treatment of Subjects with Macular Edema associated with Non-Infectious Uveitis.</li>\r\n 	<li>A Multicentre, Controlled ,Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Uveitis','Uveal tract is the vascular middle coat of the eye ball.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-20 05:34:14','2019-06-20 05:34:14','',74,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/06/20/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(459,1,'2019-06-21 04:58:47','2019-06-21 04:58:47','<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"breadcrumbs mb-4 clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / About Us / <strong> HVD at a Glance </strong></div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception in the year 2000, PBMA’s&nbsp;H.V.

Non-infectious uveitis can be of autoimmune origin.\r\n\r\nDepending upon the location, uveitis is divided into four types:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Anterior uveitis: Affects the anterior part of the eye and causes redness, watering and photophobia</li>\r\n 	<li>Intermediate uveitis: Only the middle part of the eye, mainly the vitreous cavity, is affected</li>\r\n 	<li>Posterior uveitis: The posterior part of the eye, mainly the retina and choroid, is affected</li>\r\n 	<li>Panuveitis: The entire uveal tract is affected</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach attack can be treated depending upon the cause, location and severity of the inflammation. The treatment offered at H.V. Desai Eye Hospital varies from topical drops, injections inside the eye and/or oral medications. At times, a depot steroid injection is used, which causes the slow release of the drug into the eye .The drug usually lasts for several weeks and close monitoring of such patients is required with regular follow ups.\r\n\r\nUveitis with glaucoma and uveitis with vitreoretinal complications are handled in close cooperation with specialised consultants in the respective fields.\r\n\r\nThe hospital is well-equipped with modern machines, instruments and facilities such as fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, ultrasonography, ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography.\r\n\r\nThe department has undertaken several research projects in this section, which include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>A Phase 3 trial-Controlled, Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye</li>\r\n 	<li>PEACHTREE: A Phase 3 trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension for the Treatment of Subjects with Macular Edema associated with Non-Infectious Uveitis</li>\r\n 	<li>A Multicentre, Controlled, Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;','Uveitis','Uveal tract is the vascular middle coat of the eye ball.

Now the world’s largest eye care complex, Aravind served 4.7 million outpatients and performed more than 463,000 surgeries and laser procedures in the 2016-17 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nOn Litwin’s first trip to India, Venkataswamy took him to an eye camp in Pondicherry. One thousand people received cataract surgery over the course of a week.\r\n\r\n“I was converted,” Litwin reminisced. “I realized something magical was going on. If one patient is static like a bird on a branch, an eye camp is different; more like a flock of birds sweeping across the sky.”\r\n\r\nOn that inaugural trip, Litwin introduced Aravind to the newly-developed technology of intra-ocular lenses. IOLs revolutionized cataract surgery. With Seva’s support, the Aravind system established in-country IOL manufacturing, bringing the cost down to the point where cataract surgery is so affordable that no one is turned away for lack of funds.\r\n\r\n“The Aravind eye care system is fulfilling Dr. V’s vision of solving blindness,” said Litwin. “There has been someone on Seva’s Board of Directors from the Aravind system from the beginning. They help us, they teach us, and we work collaboratively on projects.”\r\n\r\nOn his most recent trip, Litwin visited Pune for the first time, to meet with the top brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital. HV Desai is involved in a Seva initiative to establish Vision Centers, “small optical shops in remote areas where there are no eye hospitals and tremendous numbers of blind people,” explained Litwin. Trained staff at these centers can prescribe glasses, treat diseases with antibiotics and take cell-phone photos of more complex problems to send to an eye hospital for diagnosis. The centers arrange transportation to the hospital for patients needing surgery. “We hope to reach a billion people through this approach,” Litwin said.\r\n\r\nDr. Colonel M. Deshpande at HV Desai, who worked with Venkataswamy, shared with Litwin that vision centers suffered from high staff turnover due to their remote locations. In response, a new system was devised where the centers started operating once a week on Market Day, at a central location like a religious institution.\r\n\r\nPeople now know that they attend to their eye care needs on Market Day. Litwin will share this and other creative solutions with staff at Seva, who work with eye care providers in more than 20 countries.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\nSeva is able to use insights like these from Litwin’s trips to India to inform their work in other countries facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins have formed several lifelong friendships with Indian colleagues over the years. On this most recent trip, they visited Dr. Asim Sil and his wife, Dr. Subhra Sil, at Vivekananda Mission Ashram Netra Niramay Niketan eye hospital, near Kolkata.\r\n\r\nThey’ve known Asim and Suhbra for 12 years, and Litwin has worked with them on earlier projects, like establishing a corneal transplant program. They now vacation regularly together, including a recent river trip in the Sundarbans, an area that sends patients to one of the two eye hospitals Seva supports in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Aravind Eye Care System sets the gold standard for eye care in India. The system’s latest branch hospital, which just opened in Chennai a few months ago, has the capacity to treat 6,000 patients daily. This new hospital is being run by Dr. S. Aravind – who was 12 years old when Dick and Judith first met him – and his wife, Dr. Haripriya, a dynamic cataract surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins’ many volunteer visits and personal relationships have grown Seva’s partnership network in India to include 60 partner eye care institutions based in 17 Indian states. Seva and its partners in other countries continue to benefit from best practices developed in India to make eye care accessible and affordable worldwide.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_bottom_content\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\n</div>','Eye Doc Makes Annual India Trip, Strengthens Partnership to Prevent, Reverse Blindness','On his most recent trip, Litwin visited\r\nPune for the first time, to meet with the\r\ntop brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital.','inherit','closed','closed','','111-revision-v1','','','2019-06-25 10:55:57','2019-06-25 10:55:57','',111,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/06/25/111-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(524,1,'2019-06-25 10:58:33','2019-06-25 10:58:33','<p class=\"m-story-header__intro\"><strong>The Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages.</strong></p>\r\nThe Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages. One week in May, starting from the second Sunday of the month — May 13 to May 19 this year — is observed as World Retinoblastoma Week, to raise awareness about retinoblastoma (RB), which is a life-threatening eye cancer affecting newborn and very young children up to 5 years of age.\r\n\r\nIt can occur either in one eye or both. According to Iksha Foundation, reported incidences of RB are increasing. Doctors suggest systemising eye screenings for toddlers will go a long way in preventing childhood blindness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Sonal S Chaugule, consultant, ophthalmic plastic surgery, orbit and ocular oncology, H V Desai Eye Hospital, Pune, “Awareness about retinoblastoma is low and early detection is crucial to give the best chance of saving the child’s life, eye and vision. Early detection and proper treatment will ensure 95 per cent of the children diagnosed with RB are saved from death, 90 per cent have their eye intact and 85 per cent have their vision protected.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, in India, a child is taken to an eye specialist only when there is any notable problem, which makes treatment of RB at a later stage much harder,” she said. Against this background, she suggests that systemised screening of eye for any abnormality in infants/toddlers should be made mandatory and sensitising doctors and healthcare authorities at different levels assumes great importance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thanmaya Bekkalale, founder and trustee, Iksha Foundation, “We only know the reported cases of RB, there are numerous cases that go unreported.

clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Our Facilities / Specialities /<strong> Retina </strong></div>\r\n\r\nRetinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)\r\n\r\nThis disease occurs in prematurely born and underweight babies due to lack of development of the retina. It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-25 14:01:23','2019-06-25 14:01:23','',74,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/06/25/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(582,1,'2019-06-25 14:02:03','2019-06-25 14:02:03','<div class=\"breadcrumbs mb-4 clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Our Facilities / Specialities /<strong> Glaucoma</strong></div>\r\n\r\nV. Desai Eye Hospital specialises in dealing with all types of glaucoma, including primary, secondary, paediatric and end-stage glaucoma. At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','A speciality clinic of H.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

LASIK helps in the treatment of a wide range of refractive errors such as Myopia (nearsightedness), hypermetropia (farsightedness) and astigmatism.\r\n\r\nAt H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we believe in helping people get rid of their glasses and educating them about LASIK surgery. For those who are found to be unfit for LASIK, we provide PRK.\r\nThe availability of the latest technologically advanced diagnostic equipment and laser technology has enabled us to provide better, safer and predictable outcomes. Wavefront-guided LASIK is among the most preferred methods for vision correction worldwide. With its excellent safety profile, patient comfort and superior visual outcomes, wavefront-guided laser platforms provide the best image quality with a clearer vision. The entire vision correction procedure takes less than 15 minutes, and patients are able to resume their day-to-day activities the very next day.\r\n\r\nH.V. DESAI Eye Hospital is equipped with the best diagnostics equipment such as the pentacamHR, corneal wavefront analyser -Keratron scout and ORK wavefront analyser.\r\n\r\n<strong>Schwind Combi Wavefront Analyser</strong>\r\n\r\nH.V.

One week in May, starting from the second Sunday of the month — May 13 to May 19 this year — is observed as World Retinoblastoma Week, to raise awareness about retinoblastoma (RB), which is a life-threatening eye cancer affecting newborn and very young children up to 5 years of age.\r\n\r\nIt can occur either in one eye or both. According to Iksha Foundation, reported incidences of RB are increasing. Doctors suggest systemising eye screenings for toddlers will go a long way in preventing childhood blindness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Sonal S Chaugule, consultant, ophthalmic plastic surgery, orbit and ocular oncology, H V Desai Eye Hospital, Pune, “Awareness about retinoblastoma is low and early detection is crucial to give the best chance of saving the child’s life, eye and vision. Early detection and proper treatment will ensure 95 per cent of the children diagnosed with RB are saved from death, 90 per cent have their eye intact and 85 per cent have their vision protected.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, in India, a child is taken to an eye specialist only when there is any notable problem, which makes treatment of RB at a later stage much harder,” she said. Against this background, she suggests that systemised screening of eye for any abnormality in infants/toddlers should be made mandatory and sensitising doctors and healthcare authorities at different levels assumes great importance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thanmaya Bekkalale, founder and trustee, Iksha Foundation, “We only know the reported cases of RB, there are numerous cases that go unreported.

Desai Eye Hospital, Pune, in a project that is expected to help thousands of Indians regain their sight.\n\nThe renowned eye care clinic serves a region of more than 37 million people and conducts field visits within a 350km radius. In the past year alone, more than 580,000 patients sought help from the hospital, with 34,000 of those undergoing cataract surgery.\n\nZeiss and CBM have also penned an agreement with the Poona Blind Men Association, which operates the hospital and will cover the cost of cataract surgery for patients who cannot afford it.\n\n\"In India, one of the world\'s most populous countries, there is a real need for ophthalmologists with the right training. With this new centre, we\'re doing our part to enable top-quality ophthalmic care. In the future, poorer people in remote regions will also benefit from this.\" CBM CEO Dr Rainer Brockhaus said.\n\nCarl Zeiss Meditec chairman Dr Ludwin Monz said the new phacoemulsification training centre was the result of a longstanding collaboration between CBM and Zeiss. The two entities previously combined to open a specialist training centre in Paraguay last year.\n\n“Thanks to this collaboration, we\'re helping to establish modern ophthalmic techniques in countries like India, thereby improving eye care treatment for patients,\" he said.\n\nPhacoemulsification has been a standard procedure in countries such as Germany for several decades. However, it has been much slower in reaching many developing countries.\n\n&nbsp;','Zeiss opens phaco training centre in India','','inherit','closed','closed','','861-autosave-v1','','','2019-07-18 14:03:19','2019-07-18 14:03:19','',861,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/07/18/861-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(884,1,'2019-07-18 14:08:30','2019-07-18 14:08:30','<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / About Us / <strong> Our Supporters </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"row mt-5\">\n\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rotary-International.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CBM.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPCB.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HelpAge-India.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"row mt-5\">\n\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Orbis.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICEH.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Fred-Hollows-Foundation-1.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sightsavers-1.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"row mt-5\">\n\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MCKS-Trust-Fund.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vision4Children.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Seva.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cognizant-Foundation.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"row mt-5\">\n\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vision-Foundation-of-India.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SBI.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Swades-Foundation.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Wonder-Work.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div class=\"row mt-5\">\n\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mukul-Madhav-Foundation.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	<div class=\"col-md-3\">\n		<img src=\"http://test.hvd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Counsel-of-General-of-Japan.png\" alt=\"Logo - \" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\n	</div>\n\n	\n\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','Our Supporters','','inherit','closed','closed','','279-revision-v1','','','2019-07-18 14:08:30','2019-07-18 14:08:30','',279,'http://test.hvd.com/2019/07/18/279-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(885,1,'2019-07-18 14:10:03','2019-07-18 14:10:03','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Education /<strong> Optometry</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>College of Optometry is established as a constituent unit of PBMA’s H.V.Desai Eye Hospital, Pune with the state – of the art facilities in terms of classroom, spacious OPD, laboratories, and dedicated to creating pool of theoretically sound and professionally skilled man power with human values.
