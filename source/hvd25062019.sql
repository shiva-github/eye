You can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">the field guide for this release</a> for more detailed information about what was included and how it all works.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>327 individual volunteers contributed to the release. If you would like to be a part of that number for future releases, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">the Core team blog</a> and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Successful WordPress Translation Day 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Translation Day is a 24-hour event organised by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">the Polyglots team</a> where community members from all over the world come together to translate WordPress into their local languages. For the fourth edition held on 11 May, 183 brand new contributors joined the Polyglots team from 77 communities across 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WP Translation Day is a great time for focussed contributions to localizing WordPress, but these contributions can happen at any time of the year, so if you would like to help make WordPress available in your local language, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots\">the Polyglots team blog</a> and join the #polyglots channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Plugin Guidelines Proposal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugins team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">has proposed some updates</a> to the guidelines for developers on the Plugin Directory. The majority of the proposed changes are intended to address significant issues faced by developers who do not speak English as a first language, making the Plugin DIrectory a more accessible and beneficial place for everyone.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal will be open for comments until late June, so the community is encouraged to get involved with commenting on them and the direction they will take the Plugin Directory. If you would like to be involved in this discussion, comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">the proposal</a> and join the #plugin review team in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continued Gutenberg Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the block editor was first released as part of WordPress Core in v5.0, development has continued in leaps and bounds with a new release every two weeks. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\">The latest update</a> includes some great incremental improvements that will be merged into the 5.2.2 release of WordPress along with the other recent enhancements.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the editor enhancements, work has been ongoing in the Gutenberg project to bring the block editing experience to the rest of the WordPress dashboard. This second phase of the project has been going well and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/31/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-20/\">the latest update</a> shows how much work has been done so far.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the Block Library project that aims to bring a searchable library of available blocks right into the editor is deep in the planning phase with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/28/block-library-initial-explorations/\">a recent update</a> showing what direction the team is taking things.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved in planning and development of Gutenberg and the block editor, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/\">Design</a> team blogs and join the #core, #design, and #core-editor channels in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The 5.2.2 release of WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/28/5-2-2-release-agenda/\">is currently in development</a> with a planned release date of 13 June.</li><li>Version 2.1.1 of the WordPress Coding Standards <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.1.1\">has been released</a> containing seven small, but relevant fixes.</li><li>The Theme Review Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\">have updated the details</a> of how the Trusted Authors Program works.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/29/who-wants-to-test-the-new-wordcamp-blocks/\">WordCamp-specific blocks have been launched for WordCamp sites</a> with organizers needing to sign up in order to test them out.</li><li>Continuing the growing trend of other platforms adopting the Gutenberg editor, it has now <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\">been ported to a plugin for OctoberCMS</a>.</li><li>Version 3.0 of the popular WordPress development environment, Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), <a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html\">was released this month</a>.</li><li>The Community Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/31/the-4-gets-in-wordpress-community-organizing/\">published some info</a> clarifying what organizers get (and don’t get) from being involved with their local communities. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

We also had an amazing line-up of speakers with 3 tracks and 3 workshops, along with on-time information shared to our attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2020 to be Held in Porto, Portugal</h3>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, organizers announced that next year WCEU is coming to Porto, June 4-6. Porto is Portugal&#8217;s second largest city, known for its beautiful beaches, port wine exports, bridges, vineyards, charming cobblestone streets, and affordability. It also has a vibrant and growing WordPress community. Portugal is home to <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2015/07/09/ze-fontainhas-how-wordcamp-europe-came-to-be/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zé Fontainhas</a>, one of the original creators of WordCamp Europe. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/josefreitas2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jose Freitas</a>, who will be heading up the local team in Portugal, has been working with WordPress since 2008 and has been involved with the community since 2013. He said the Portuguese WordPress community has been working on its application to host WCEU for three years. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have WCEU in Porto next year,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;Portugal is indeed a small country but we have a good WordPress community. At Porto we have had a monthly WordPress Meetup since January 2014, without failing a month. WordPress is growing quickly in Portugal and every day we have people joining our community.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The greater community is connected on Facebook through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpportugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Portugal</a> group, which has more than 4,400 members.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We found that for some people, mostly beginners, it’s difficult to start using the support forums,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;So we made a Facebook group and people can ask questions and receive help or feedback related to their projects. Most of the users are people that made their own websites and websites for non profit organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Up until now, Portugal has hosted one WordCamp per year, alternating between Porto and Lisbon locations. Following 2020, local organizers plan to host two camps per year, and WC Lisboa is expected to be scheduled for October 2020.</p>\n<p>The Porto community had formidable competition in its journey to securing the opportunity to host WCEU 2020, beating out Athens, Granada, Manchester, and Torino. Freitas attributes his team&#8217;s success to its dedication to improving Porto&#8217;s application for the past three years, following a disappointing attempt in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First it was only a dream,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;After, it was <em>what if…</em> We applied the first time in 2016 to WCEU 2017. We were in the final decision but the event went to Paris, as we all know. So we started right then the application to 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made it better, stronger, complete with all the new requirements. Each WCEU was getting something new and in each one we added the new thing to our documentation. We made a strict budget, with realistic numbers in all parameters. I think that was important for the people who made the selection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WCEU 2020 sessions will be held in English. Freitas said the majority of Portuguese people have a good understanding of English and most in the WordPress community are fluent in both languages. </p>\n<p>The maximum capacity for the venue is 8,000 people. WCEU&#8217;s arrangement for 2020 allows attendance to go up to 4,000, in case the event has another record-breaking year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a wonderful venue in the city center and surrounded by a garden and a balcony with amazing views of the river and part of the city,&#8221; Freitas said.</p>\n<p>WCEU 2019 local lead Bernhard Kau will be joining the 2020 team as the global lead to provide a smooth transition from one year to the next. Attendees can expect some of the successful aspects of the 2019 event to make a return at next year&#8217;s WCEU.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The additions of WP Cafe and Wellness at WCEU were a big success and I would love to have more space for them at WordCamp Europe 2020 in Porto,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;There are also some other ideas helping attendees staying healthy, both physically and mentally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I have never been to Portugal, I am very excited to visit another country. I have met some members of the Portuguese Community on WordCamps throughout Europe and they are some of the most friendly people you can find.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For those who are considering adding WCEU 2020 in Porto to their calendars, Freitas offered a preview of what attendees can expect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine yourself… it is June, 3, 2020. There’s one day to go before WCEU.</p>\n<p>You go to the city center to know a little of the city. You walk in small and narrow streets and find that some of those have a history of more that a thousand years. You ask some directions, because you don’t want to use smartphone maps, and people are nice and even offer to take you to the place that is only 500 meters way.</p>\n<p>You go to the very old part of the city and realize that it wasn’t changed for many, many years. It was not changed because people didn’t want to and because now it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>\n<p>You sit near the river and look at the bridge designed and build by a student of Eiffel (yep, that Eiffel). The sun has made the Douro river look like silver and you finally get why the Romans gave the name of Porto (port) to the place.</p>\n<p>It’s time to lunch some tasty and delightful Portuguese food. Don’t skip the dessert. To burn some calories you’ll go to the check the venue.</p>\n<p>You pass the old Reitoria building (the place were the university principal used to work) &#8211; Porto has the biggest Portuguese university &#8211; and see a garden with trees, flowers and even some peacocks.</p>\n<p>You enter there and find the way to the venue: it looks like the top of a spaceship, like the ones in the movies. There’s a banner: &#8220;WordCamp Europe 2020.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now you feel that you’re only a few hours away from the moment you have been waiting for. But, let’s go because you have to see other parts of the city.</p>\n<p>The next day, you join hundreds of WordPress people who are helping the community in Contributor Day. There is a lot to do before the two conference days and workshops, before visiting the sponsors area, before meeting some of the nice folks that you didn’t see since last year, before making new friends.</p>\n<p>After all, it’s possible to make new friends in an event of thousands of people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is made possible every year by a massive team of organizers and volunteers who help keep costs low, in addition to sponsors. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The organising team would like to thank all of the volunteers for contributing to an amazing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/1um7usNZqT\">pic.twitter.com/1um7usNZqT</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Europe (@WCEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1142455860683333632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 2020 team put out the <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">call for organizers</a> after announcing the host city.

This section contains fields that enable users to share how much time they contribute to WordPress on a weekly basis, which teams they contribute to, and whether or not those contributions are sponsored. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />New WordPress.org User Profile Fields</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each field is optional and will only appear if the Hours and Teams fields are filled in. The sponsored tag will only appear next to the Contributions heading if you answer Yes to being sponsored and the other fields are filled in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Middleton describes these fields as a step towards a possible version one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2018/11/05/proposal-five-for-the-future-acknowledgement-page/\">Five for the Future program</a> that was published last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it will also help with transparency, and might facilitate how teams set internal expectations for how much time different contributors might have to spend on a project or ongoing task,&#8221; she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the profile fields, the official <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">WordPress Jobs Board</a> has also been updated to include a new <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/job_category/contributor/\">Contributor position</a>. The goal is to make it easier for companies to find and hire people interested in becoming sponsored contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are the first iteration with plans to enhance them in the future.

This may aid in transparency and avoiding conflicts of interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side of the coin, does it make sense for the company&#8217;s name to be public information, or should contributors only share that information with team leads or reps on a 1-on-1 basis? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel as though knowing someone&#8217;s contributions are sponsored is only half of the equation.

He attributed much of its continued success to the availability of the Gutenberg plugin, which allows for quick iteration and testing. More than 150,000 posts are published per day using the block editor, which Mullenweg said is &#8220;a testament to the long development period&#8221; that gave the team an opportunity to work out bugs and make it usable for a large number of people.</p>\n<p>Since its initial release, the block editor has added a host of notable improvements, including block management capabilities, a cover block with nested elements, widgets as blocks, block grouping, and snackbar style notices. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted a few beautiful and innovative examples of Gutenberg in the wild. Two projects from <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Human Made</a> showcase Gutenberg-powered designs (<a href=\"https://www.artefactgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">artefactgroup.com</a>) and an AI integration that analyzes a user&#8217;s writing in the editor (<a href=\"https://ingenuity.siemens.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ingenuity.siemens.com</a>.) </p>\n<p>Election season is ramping up in the U.S. and Gutenberg-powered sites, like <a href=\"https://hurst4delegate.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hurst4delegate.com</a>, are starting to pop up. Mullenweg noted that 21/24 of the current democratic candidates for President are using WordPress for their sites. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Whitehouse.gov</a> also switched from Drupal to WordPress earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg also gave a quick preview of some of the upcoming Gutenberg features that are currently being developed on GitHub. Most of them are still in the prototype stage. The team is creating a system to install new blocks online, which will tie into the planned block directory. Mullenweg said Blocks could become a new top-level menu item in the WordPress admin, with screens dedicated to block discovery. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"A block directory is coming that will take over other “top level navigation” and brings a “playfulness” to discovering <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> blocks.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wsiHcPaVuL\">pic.twitter.com/wsiHcPaVuL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1142044607800369153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>He showed demos of the navigation block in progress, a prototype for adding realistic motion to block movement, an experimental footnotes block, and a demo of resizing images with &#8220;snap to grid&#8221; capabilities.

He said the new editor is operational but development is slow moving because the mobile engineers essentially have to duplicate all of the work that has been done by hundreds of Gutenberg contributors thus far. </p>\n<h3>Q&#038;A Highlights Governance, Core Maintenance, and the Future of WordPress Themes</h3>\n<p>The Q&#038;A portion of the session featured a variety of topics, ranging from an aggressive tirade about licensing and Envato, to more relevant inquiries about the future of WordPress themes. While this format of interaction has its shortcomings, it gives community members the opportunity to check on the status of issues where they have a particular interest. </p>\n<p>One attendee asked if WordPress.org plans to implement a more democratic structure for decision making. Mullenweg seemed to interpret the question as referencing a system where tens or hundreds of millions of WordPress users would participate in making decisions on features through a vote or some other form of feedback. In contrast, he said WordPress&#8217; current approach is for leadership to try to get a sense for what the most common issues are through polls and public channels and allow those issues to help shape the project&#8217;s roadmap. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg shared that one particular issue on his mind right now is the problem of &#8220;how do I make my theme look like the demo?&#8221; He said contributors are experimenting with different types of models for making decisions that move WordPress in the direction to solve these types of problems. </p>\n<p>He said that the project&#8217;s decision making is fairly transparent, without a lot of mystery, and that the community has tons of feedback mechanisms. This is a somewhat controversial claim, as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/04/26/5-0-release-retrospective-wrap-up/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regular project contributors have expressed frustration with the lack of communication</a> surrounding important planning and decisions, such as release dates and project timing, as it pertained to how WordPress 5.0 landed. The community was frustrated by a lack of effective ways to communicate critical issues and complaints to project leadership. As a followup to this specific feedback, Josepha Haden, the new Executive Director of the WordPress project, has been diligent to track and communicate how leadership is working to improve communication.</p>\n<p>Another attendee asked if WordPress themes will become obsolete after Gutenberg gains more site-building capabilities. Mullenweg predicted they will always be a part of WordPress but seemed inclined to let the market decide the fate of themes.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are going to change for sure. I don’t think they ever go away.” He said he could see developers offering an array of different designs that could be used as a starting point. Although a WordPress theme has a very specific definition right now (as far as what types of files are included), Mullenweg said he can see that  definition evolving over time. He said he could see themes becoming like a starter template or a library of patterns to choose from, or even a set of complex layouts that could work across different themes. </p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to decouple themes a little bit but I don’t know how or what that will look like,” Mullwenweg said. He also noted that a lot of themes right now represent a similar aesthetic, often business minimalist that use white and blue colors. Design trends have the potential to shift dramatically as Gutenberg and themes evolve to allow users more control over how their sites are designed.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the WordPress development community is eager to switch to GitHub or another Git-based infrastructure for core development. Most of the recent feature projects have successfully matured on GitHub, with the majority of work and discussion taking place outside of Trac. One attendee asked about the possibility of moving away from Trac in the near future. Mullenweg said that this year the team that works on WordPress.org is prioritizing changes to the directory, but in the meantime anyone with Python knowledge is welcome to contribute to tweaking Trac for improvements in the interim before WordPress moves to Git-based development.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’d love to move off of Trac as much as the next person. In the interim I’m working some cool tools to make life easier using the Elasticsearch cluster I built for it. Let me know if you want to help! <a href=\"https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ\">https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; William Earnhardt (@earnjam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/earnjam/status/1142057095044444160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response to a question about blockchain technology and WordPress, Mullenweg said he has long been an enthusiast in this area and loves the idea of open source applying to money, as well as having a distributed ledger. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But I can’t think of any problem in core WordPress right now that the overhead of a blockchain would really improve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything I could think of right now would probably be plugin territory.&#8221; However, he said that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordproof-plugin-timestamps-wordpress-content-on-the-blockchain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof plugin&#8217;s timestamping WordPress content</a> on the blockchain is among one of the best ideas he has seen for this technology so far.</p>\n<p>When asked how he plans to &#8220;balance chasing the new and shiny with all of WordPress&#8217; existing legacy APIs,&#8221; Mullenweg said that &#8220;PHP is going to be crucial to us for many years to come.&#8221; He recognized that the project has fallen behind in maintenance with some of its older APIs but that work on Gutenberg can be done in parallel. </p>\n<p>The new triage team is currently going through all the tickets, refreshing patches, and working on taking them to resolution. Mullenweg noted that WordCamp Europe hosted the first ever triage table at its contributor day and said that this new area is ripe for contribution.</p>\n<p>The REST API, despite its broad support and noteworthy contributors, is one area that Mullenweg said has held Gutenberg back. He said it still does not have the demonstrated use that its advocates predicted when working to get it merged into core and cautioned that WordPress should always use an API first before shipping it to the world.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the Q&#038;A by estimating that Gutenberg is only 10% of the way down the road towards solving the problems that WordPress contributors set out to tackle. He predicts that building on this initial effort will carry into the next decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:48:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Free Event: Post Status to Live Stream Publish Online July 8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/free-event-post-status-to-live-stream-publish-online-july-8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1674:\"<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a> will be live streaming <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Publish Online</a> on July 8-9, 2019.

It is used by tens of thousands of developers and downloaded nearly 500,000 times each month.</p>\n<p>Gatsby founder Kyle Mathews created <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby Inc</a>. as a company to further the project&#8217;s goals, and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">received $3.8M in seed funding</a> in May 2018. The investment is being used to build cloud services for Gatsby and improve Gatsby&#8217;s core open source software. As the company has grown, Gatsby is beginning to invest more heavily in the open source ecosystem that surrounds the project.</p>\n<p>With WordPress powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">34% of the top 10 million websites</a>, it&#8217;s only natural that Gatsby would look to WPGraphQL, one of the most promising projects in the WP ecosystem, for its next investment in open source. The more WordPress developers Gatsby can get using GraphQL and JavaScript, the more it benefits the greater Gatsby ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of developers using Gatsby to build sites where the content is managed by WordPress is growing,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;The current `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin pulls data into Gatsby using the WordPress REST API, but the REST API has a lot of pain points that are proving to be very difficult to get past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL solves many of those pain points already, and has potential to solve even more. The more robust WPGraphQL is, the better it is for all JavaScript consumers, whether it be Next.js, Gridsome (a Vue static site generator) or Gatsby.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl followed the Gatsby project from afar before striking up a relationship with the team through the various Slack channels where the community is active. A year and a half ago, he moved the <a href=\"http://docs.wpgraphql.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">docs.wpgraphql.com</a> site from WordPress to Gatsby, where the content is stored in Markdown files on Github. This allows users in the community to contribute to the docs by submitting pull requests.</p>\n<p>In February 2019, Bahl gave a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/03/08/jason-bahl-building-static-sites-with-wordpress-gatsby-and-wpgraphql/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building Static Sites with WordPress, Gatsby and WPGraphQL</a>&#8221; After that he saw more growth in the  crossover ecosystems &#8211; more people in the Gatsby Slack asking about WordPress, and more developers in the WPGraphQL Slack asking about Gatsby.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been following all things GraphQL for a few years, so Gatsby has been on my radar for a while as Gatsby uses GraphQL to create a &#8216;content mesh&#8217; where data can be pulled from many sources into one Gatsby site,&#8221; Bahl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The more I followed Gatsby from afar, the more intrigued I was. The development experience of Gatsby is great, especially if you enjoy React, which I do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl is active in both Slacks, on both GitHub repos, and on Twitter, helping people build Gatsby sites with WordPress and GraphQL, which is how he developed a relationship with the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In mid April I made it known to a few people that I would love to work on WPGraphQL full-time if I had the opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On May 30, Kyle Matthews direct messaged me on Twitter saying Gatsby is planning on investing in WordPress more and they&#8217;d love to chat. The following week I had some video calls with Kyle, Sam, and some other folks on the Gatsby team, and they made me a formal offer to join the Gatsby teams to make WPGraphQL the best it can be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WPGraphQL project already has a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpgraphql-project-gains-momentum-with-growing-library-of-extensions-for-popular-wordpress-projects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rapidly growing library of extensions</a> for popular WordPress plugins, despite the fact that the project has not yet reached a stable 1.0 release. Bahl&#8217;s new opportunity with the Gatsby team will enable him to work with the community&#8217;s momentum to get WPGraphQL further on its roadmap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working on WPGraphQL full time will allow me to work on features and bugs that I’ve not had adequate time to focus on while also maintaining a full time job,&#8221; Bahl said.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL is used in production by many already, but it’s still pre 1.0 because of some breaking changes I foresee but haven’t had adequate time to dedicate to addressing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl will also be available to provide better resources for the community, such as documentation, example codebases, and courses and tutorials, in addition to attending more WordCamps and other conferences, participating in podcasts, and interacting on GitHub issues, Slack, and other communication channels.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;It will also provide more time to focus on conversations on whether GraphQL should be part of WordPress core (or not), and educate the community and core maintainers on the tradeoffs,&#8221; Bahl said. </p>\n<p>In hiring Bahl to work on WPGraphQL, Gatsby is making a significant investment in the WordPress community that depends on this project. The improved support and quicker pace of development should bring peace of mind to those who are already using WPGraphQL in production. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ll also be working closely with other members of the Gatsby team to make the experience of using Gatsby with WordPress a great experience,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We have a lot of ideas about how WPGraphQL can make the Gatsby + WordPress experience a fantastic one for developers and users alike.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 19:52:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce.com Clarifies Its Policy on Selling CBD Products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90955\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-com-clarifies-its-policy-on-selling-cbd-products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6713:\"<p>Last week, a member of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/woohelp/\">WooCommerce Help and Share Facebook</a> group who sells Cannabidiol or CBD products submitted a post that included an email exchange with WooCommerce support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the exchange, the support rep explained to the store owner that when their WooCommerce.com account was connected to a WordPress.com login, it then fell under the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/store-guidelines/\">WordPress.com store guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the guidelines, controlled substances (including marijuana, cannabidiol or CBD, and other cannabis-derived products) are not allowed to be sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep goes on to say that this included but was not limited to sites using WordPress.com, the Jetpack plugin, and any extensions from WooCommerce.com.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The store owner is then informed that their store will be disconnected from Automattic hosted services if they continue to sell CBD products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Legal Document Becomes a Source of Confusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep provided the store owner with a link to the most <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-cbd/\">frequently asked questions</a> on selling CBD products using WooCommerce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording of the document made it seem as though there was a difference between downloading the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory or WooCommerce.com. It also appeared to apply limits on how the GPL licensed software could be used. Here is a cached version of the original document. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Can WooCommerce be used to sell cannabis-derived products such as CBD oil? </strong></p><p><strong>Yes</strong>, if you download the WooCommerce plugin directly from WordPress.org or install the WooCommerce plugin via the Plugins page of your site from WordPress.org.</p><p><strong>No</strong>, if you download and install the WooCommerce plugin directly from WooCommerce.com.</p><p>It is the same WooCommerce plugin, but the location of download makes a difference?<strong><br />What’s the difference?</strong> <br />The difference is ownership.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WordPress.org</strong> is open-source software and is hosted through a third-party company.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WooCommerce.com and WordPress.com</strong> is hosted through Automattic.

As our software is open source, we do not limit its use. </p><p>However, while you can use the code of our WooCommerce plugin to sell products derived from cannabis and hemp, you cannot use <strong>services</strong> offered directly by Automattic to support those stores. This is the case whether the products are over or under 0.3% THC, and whether they are derived from hemp or cannabis. Automattic’s direct services include, but are not limited to, WordPress.com, WooCommerce.com, and the Jetpack plugin.</p><p>This means that you can use the open source WooCommerce plugin to sell cannabis-derived products, but you cannot:</p><p>Connect your site to Automattic’s servers in <em>WooCommerce > Extensions > WooCommerce.com Subscriptions</em> for automatic extension updates or at WordPress.com.</p><p>Use WooCommerce services that depend on a Jetpack connection, such as <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/\">WooCommerce Shipping</a> or <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/\">WooCommerce Tax</a>. </p><p>Host your site on WordPress.com. </p><p><strong>Can I get help for my WooCommerce store?</strong><br />Yes. Our WooCommerce.com help desk can assist you with your site if you would normally qualify to receive support. You might also receive help from others in the WordPress.org  forums or the WooCommerce community.</p><cite>Revised WooCommerce and CBD Products FAQ</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two years, WooCommerce has increasingly relied on Jetpack and its connection to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure to provide services. These include <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/\">WooCommerce Shipping</a>, the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/mobile/\">WooCommerce app</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.taxjar.com/woocommerce-services-automated-tax-calculations-powered-taxjar/\">Automated Tax Calculations</a>. In 2017, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/wooconf-state-of-the-woo/\">Todd Wilkens made it clear</a> that WooCommerce would continue to make extensive use of Jetpack to provide cloud services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the policy makes things clearer, CBD store owners will need to determine if they can live without the conveniences provided by Jetpack, WooCommerce.com, and WordPress.com. This situation is also a reminder to all store owners to double check a service&#8217;s policies before connecting any sites. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 01:02:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Watch the Free WordCamp Europe 2019 Live Stream June 21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90487\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-the-free-wordcamp-europe-2019-live-stream-june-21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2026:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2019</a> kicks off tomorrow, June 20, with Contributor Day.

For those who cannot attend in person, WCEU will be live streaming the main conference on June 21-22 for free.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous years, no tickets or registration will be required for live stream viewers. Removing this logistical hurdle makes the conference more accessible to viewers who may want to pop in for a session or two. </p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg will be giving an address at 2PM in Berlin on Friday, June 21, and his presentation usually includes some newsworthy announcements. Whether you&#8217;re interested in Gutenberg development, community relations, design, or business, there&#8217;s a session for a wide range of WordPress users. Those who are viewing from afar can <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/schedule/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out the schedule</a> and plan which sessions to watch online. </p>\n<p>As it was last year, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wceu-team-is-working-on-pwa-support-for-all-wordcamp-websites\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WCEU website is a Progressive Web App (PWA)</a> that allows users to favorite the talks they want to attend.

And it was a fantastic talk with Speakers.</p>\n<p>By the time you read this, I would have experienced my first international talk in<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/sessions/\"> WordCamp Europe 2019</a> at<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2019/04/30/wp-cafe/\"> WPCafe</a>. And would have moved to the next :). In this essay, I will be sharing how I found my career path, how WordPress changed my life, why I took challenges. I am a non-technical person, if you are a newbie, struggling with your career, stopped taking challenges, gave up and lose hope, especially women’s, then this may be your compelling decision to be here. I am sharing my short story towards WordPress and putting some points that make me take these decisions.</p>\n<h3>Who am I?</h3>\n<p>My name is<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/about-afsana/\"> Afsana Multani</a>, an artist by hobby and a WordPress enthusiast. You must think, why and how I work with WordPress? WordPress wasn’t the first choice in my life. My very first choice was painting. I didn&#8217;t even know I will be starting working with WordPress. :) To learn and work with WordPress, became the dream of my life, to follow this, I started working as a Customer Support Executive at theDotstore, which is a Venture of MULTIDOTS.</p>\n<p>I was born &amp; brought up in a reserved middle-class family, residing in Bhavnagar, a small city of Gujarat, India. Currently, I live in Ahmedabad. The family thinking is one which follows age-old customs and traditions and has stayed away from innovations. Where, most of the time, children do not have the freedom to dream, to develop, or to choose their life, to do something new. As a child, I had everything needed to live a better life &#8211; food, shelter, and clothes. But one thing was missing &#8211; “freedom.” I am the second one of four kids in my family and was lucky enough to study further.</p>\n<p>Though I never had a chance to talk with my father about my career, and what I want to do in life or how life will be after studies. I was sure I have to do something and make my parents proud.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Besides all the strict rules and conventional thinking, my parents trusted me and allowed me to study further.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mother never pushed me to cook or do household chores, as she spends her entire life doing this stuff. She loved to study, but due to this old thinking pattern, she had to drop her studies after her 3rd Standard. She starts cooking at home, with all household chores, preparing to get married one day.</p>\n<p>You would say, it’s not an age to do this. But it was her childhood, where other children were playing with toys, she continued playing with real-life. She determined never give up; whatever I am today because of her if she does not do that I would never have the courage to study further. I was good in studies, and get 1st in every Curriculum activity; the reason was my parents. I wanted to see them happy and proud. I learned one thing from her &#8211;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Never give up on your dreams, work harder for what you want, and help others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I always have struggled for my future path, I wasn’t sure what to do and what not to, but I learned not to be afraid of taking challenges. During the time, I was about to step into the new phase of life &#8211; “Marriage.”</p>\n<h3>Everything changed</h3>\n<p>In my sweet 16, my wedding fixed already. And my father asked me to drop studies after 10th and plan for marriage. But my mother wanted me to study; so, she convinced him. Fortunately, my life partner was also so understanding and carrying. We never met before our engagement day, but I still remember, as soon as we had our first phone call, we fell in Love. Just like that &#8211; like a Fairy Tale.</p>\n<p>Suddenly everything changes when the day came to leave my parents home. I got married early after my Higher Secondary School at the age of 18. I was a child with no idea how everything goes after marriage but has to take the responsibilities. It was a new challenge &#8211; family and household chores. Understanding new families make them happy and still living in a joint family was a challenge to decide on a career. I remember one my Grandpa says,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“life will never be better, but we have to make it better”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Can a Hobby be a Profession?</h3>\n<p>So, the answer is yes. If your hobby wakes you up in the middle of your sleep, it does. But if you let someone entering into your hobby, then it may be challenging for you to continue further. For me, the painting was my hobby, since childhood. I never found a tutor to polish my skills and learned it myself as an inspiration from my elder sister. It was a dream to be a great artist one day; I decided to join the institute after my marriage. I initiated my first painting classes name “<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/my-studio/\">AKSA</a>,” I enjoy with kids; my motto was to encourage them to develop their skills.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Studio.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>I did not have a better teacher in my childhood, so I wanted them to have one and not to struggle much to follow their path. Destiny has some other plans.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to the computer world</h3>\n<p>I also have learned PHP for a couple of months. But that was not something I am happy with so I continued my journey, finding some more opportunities.</p>\n<p>In 2012, I found my first job out of my hobby with a full-service WordPress agency &#8211;<a href=\"https://www.multidots.com/\"> MULTIDOTS</a> as a front-end developer; I had picked up quite a bit of Photoshop designing as well as HTML. Work with photoshop was fun to play with computer. I did not have a computer at home, so this job was fascinating. I decided it quickly and started building websites and learning HTML responsive coding, on my own &#8211; Google was my teacher. I love learning new things which match to my nature and interest :).</p>\n<p>I was perfectly happy as a front-end developer, yet I always felt as if there were some other types of work that I would adore more. “I just didn&#8217;t know what it was,” in 2017, I started working with WordPress.</p>\n<p>The decision to start working with WordPress comes with challenges. It feels like going back to the first-level of schooling, taking classes to pick up necessary qualification.</p>\n<p>For me, everything changed in my early 20’s. At 25, my brain woke up &#8211; it certainly feels like that. And I managed to win a job as a “Customer Support Executive” at<a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\"> thedotstore</a>. I am a talkative person, and chatting with people around the world was amazing. As my Mom says, &#8211; help, support, and make people happy. Working freely with fun was one of my visions that comes true.</p>\n<p>Thedotstore develops free and premium plugins for WooCommerce, with a focus on scalability, performance, and security. Customer satisfaction is the key success to thedotstore or any businesses. While working with IT company being a frontend developer, I came into contact with WordPress and found we can create a blog easily. But it was way far knowing about its vast community.</p>\n<h3>My first WordPress Blog</h3>\n<p>It was an enjoyable experience working on my first WordPress painting blog in 2014. :) I do not have an active link, because it was on a local server for practice.</p>\n<p>But I have recently created a new Blog “<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/\">afsanamultani.com</a>” &#8211; which is live and active :) Where I have shared my journey being with Painting Studio as well as my experiences in contribution to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>My First interaction with WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordPress Ahmedabad community already started Organizing<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ahmedabad-wp-meetup/\"> WPMeetups</a> and also planning for the first WordCamp in 2017. I participated as Volunteer in my first<a href=\"https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/\"> WordCamp Ahmedabad 2017</a>, Also have created a beautiful Selfie Booth with the team. During the day, for the first time in my life, I took the initiative to talk to different people about WordPress, got an opportunity to meet WordPress lovers, Automattician &#8211;<a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/happiness-engineer/\"> Happiness Engineer</a>, Nomad, people working remotely. Those words were new to me, and I was like- what are you saying! For me, it was a dream, “I was born for this man.” At the same time, I decided to be a Happiness Engineer one day. WordPress is not only a platform for a techie guy; it also helps a person like me to select their career path with WordPress. Doesn&#8217;t sound interesting?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WCAhmedabad2017.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>A break that got me where I am today</h3>\n<p>It was my first day when I started learning more about WordPress and its community. In November 2017, WordPress was at version 4.9.1, and I was getting in. I spend days tweaking and learning about customer support, forums, and how to get involved. I wanted to be a part of the WordPress team.</p>\n<h3>Steps I followed</h3>\n<p>Step one:- with understanding the code of conduct and how the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/\"> community</a> works.</p>\n<p>Step two:- How to get involved &#8211;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\"> make.wordpress.org</a></p>\n<p>Step three:- What are the channels and how it works.</p>\n<p>Step Four:- Go to the team channels and start surfing.</p>\n<p>Step Five:- Join the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> slack channels</a>, where you get the support and knowledge. It’s easy to join the public slack channel #forums #community-events #community-team and more.</p>\n<p>As we know, it is not easy to get started and understand everything overnight. At first, when I joined these slack channels, I found lots of people chatting and sharing information, some asking for help and some are staff who helped people to solve their problems.</p>\n<h3>First Week with WordPress</h3>\n<p>My very first week went only on reviewing those chat conversations and how to get involved. So if you are new and want to get into this, be there for a while, don&#8217;t try to understand everything at first. Please go through all the chat conversations, and gradually, you will know how it works.</p>\n<p>It’s a great platform to work; if you ask me how long I can work with WordPress, I would like to work with WordPress forever. It’s like I never think to change the platform since WordPress helps me to work freely and who does not love Freedom? :)</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dedication, Hard work, Patience, and Reading will always make you successful in any Career you choose.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was a newbie, and I didn&#8217;t even imagine it will be a fantastic journey. It took me a year to understand the community. I am now working as a customer support executive, still learning and exploring new ways of contributing to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Volunteer work</h3>\n<p>During this time, I have attended several WordCamps, and I got opportunities in organizing, speaking, and volunteering.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Organizing Experience</h3>\n<p>After WordCamp Ahmedabad 2017, it was time for our second WordCamp. We started planning for the next Lead Organiser for the event. By the time of deciding for the woman candidate. Everyone asked me if I am ready to take this challenge. My first expression was &#8211; What? Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s a dream, someone, please wake me up, :D I asked many questions at the same time. I asked myself for a while, Am I ready for the big challenge? What if I could not make it? And I recall those words &#8211; never give up, take a challenge, and try harder than what you want.</p>\n<p>I accepted the challenge, started reading<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/\"> WordCamp Organizer HandBook</a> from WordPress.org site. There’s each and everything mentioned very clear from Applying Application to the<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\"> WordCamp Central,</a> where you find all the upcoming WordCamp lists and the End of the event process. It was a fantastic experience of<a href=\"https://2018.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/organizers/\"> WordCamp Ahmedabad 2018</a>. There is one thing that I learn from this event, if you are ready to take the challenge, everyone will help you to fulfill that challenge. And it was never possible without my team and Aditya Kane, who was the mentor for the event. We are an excellent team of organizers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Organisers.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>WordCamp Speaking Experience</h3>\n<p>After volunteering, organizing, it was my dream to be a speaker. And I was fortunate to speak in<a href=\"https://2019.kolkata.wordcamp.org/speakers/\"> WordCamp Kolkata 2019</a>. I was so happy when I got an Email with “Congratulations.” Now, what? Let us prepare.</p>\n<p>Sharing<a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/afsana/20-effective-ways-to-build-a-better-customer-experience\"> “20 Effective Ways to Build a Better Customer Experience”</a> was a great experience in my life; I never imagined such a huge audience and a great team. By this time I have also contributed to upload WordCamp video on<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/04/10/afsana-multani-20-effective-ways-to-build-a-better-customer-experience/\"> WordPress.tv</a>. Learning Never Ends!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Speaker.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you are reading this, and also have a dream to be a speaker, the first thing you need to do is, write your topic and send it over. Do not think much; push that Share Button, that’s all. Sometimes, we’re afraid to push that button and miss the excellent opportunity. If you think next time, write everything, and I would be happy to push that button for you. :D Especially women, it would be so lovely to see you, take this challenge and start living your dreams. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, remember &#8211; “every successful person made mistakes” even Gandhiji, but he learned from his mistakes and promised never to repeat.</p>\n<h3>“Take new challenges, make mistakes, learn, and improve.”</h3>\n<p>Moving further to contributions, it is always fun working with your love. I believe &#8211; “Love what you do and do what you Love,” and it works.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Support Forums</li>\n<li>WordPress TV Contributor</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Editor</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Contributor</li>\n<li>WordPress Meetup Organizer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Volunteer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Lead Organizer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Speaker</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Translation Team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have done what I love, and what about you?</p>\n<p>Most importantly, I am glad to be a contributor. There&#8217;s one more thing &#8211; The<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/afsanamultanii/\"> badges</a> are the best part of WordPress I have ever seen, and it&#8217;s like a volunteer reward.</p>\n<p>So ladies and gentleman, How many badges have you collected? Share your list in comments :)</p>\n<h3>My initiative</h3>\n<p>After experiencing my contribution to WordPress, people come up with various questions, &#8211; how you have done this, and how to get involved in the community, what steps to be followed to contribute. So that makes me start this initiative <a href=\"https://iamwplearner.com/\">iamwplearner</a> as a knowledge sharing activity with a dream of helping the local as well as WordPress community through different channels and languages.</p>\n<p>Good Takeaways – iamwplearner helps beginners, startup, and college students, who are looking for the opportunity and how to involve with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Everything was possible only with the help of<a href=\"https://aslam.blog/\"> Aslam Multani</a>. He is my supporter, my backbone, and my reason for life, he is the person who always guides me and motivates me in all situations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Afsana-Aslam.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Like me, most late achievers will discover that they have more significant opportunities to succeed on alternative paths. But, today’s obsessive way for new achievement is the fear of failure for those who do not attain it. They waste our national talent and stunted creativity.</p>\n<h3>If I can do this, You can do this even better. :)</h3>\n<p>All of us love someone and something, and the thing is we cannot give up on ourselves or others- especially if society has made it harder to catch up. Most people recently born will live in the 22nd century, and they will accept the modernization in the community. This is us; a healthy society needs all of its people to recognize that they can bloom and re-bloom, grow, and succeed throughout their lives.</p>\n<p>I like to address this commitment, to all WordPress fans, especially a local womens community, to show your real talent, and break the stereotypes. Let people speak, there will be a doubt, a mistake, but if you are confident in you, no one can stop doing your best. :)<br />\nI wish you Good Luck.</p>\n<h3>What’s in the Future?</h3>\n<p>I would say, the future is yet to come. Be yourself, there are many opportunities, challenges, and learnings. I try myself ready for better today than yesterday.

This capability has traditionally been handled by plugins, which provide a variety of implementations. The goal of this new feature project is to ship basic XML sitemaps in core while providing an XML Sitemaps API for plugin developers to extend. It would also update WordPress&#8217; robots.txt file to reference the sitemap index. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TweetyThierry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thierry Muller</a>, a Developer Relations Program Manager at Google, published the details of the collaborators&#8217; plans on WordPress.org. The sitemaps included in core would be enabled by default and would index the following content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homepage</li>\n<li>Posts page</li>\n<li>Core Post Types (Pages and Posts)</li>\n<li>Custom Post Types</li>\n<li>Core Taxonomies (Tags and Categories)</li>\n<li>Custom Taxonomies</li>\n<li>Users (Authors)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although WordPress contributors have had multiple discussions regarding XML sitemaps on trac, Muller said there had not yet been a group to take ownership and get things moving forward. His proposal notes that 4 out of the top 15 plugins in the WordPress plugin directory ship with their own implementation of XML. Despite the demonstrated high demand for XML sitemaps,  the right team for getting this added to core had not been assembled until now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;XML Sitemaps is a standard across all search engines these days and any website with content which is intended to be indexed should have one,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;Having XML Sitemaps in core would speed up content discoverability and indexing. We started discussing this topic last year with Yoast and agreed that it would be great to finally make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far the initiative has received a favorable response from the community and has already gained the support of WordPress project lead Matt Mullenweg. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This makes a lot of sense, looking forward to seeing the v1 of this in core and for it to evolve in future releases and cement WordPress’ well-deserved reputation of being the best CMS for SEO,&#8221; Mullenweg commented on the proposal. </p>\n<p>Performance is one of the primary concerns that the WordPress development community has expressed regarding adding XML sitemaps to core. </p>\n<p>&#8220;As simple and straightforward as XML sitemaps are, they present some relatively significant performance challenges at scale,&#8221; Matthew Boynes, partner at <a href=\"https://alley.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alley Interactive</a>, said. &#8220;As one for-instance, how many urls are going to be in each paginated (sub-) sitemap? A sitemap index file is limited to 50,000 sitemaps, so even though each sitemap is limited to a maximum of 50,000 urls, generating 50,000 urls in one page request would be extremely difficult and non-performant to do on-the-fly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Muller and other contributors on the project have a strategy for addressing scalability concerns and are planning to keep these considerations on the forefront while building core&#8217;s implementation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for everything else, engineering new features should always be done with security and performance in mind,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;It starts at the high level architecture down to the granular details. Each Sitemap entry will only contain ,  and  which should not overload the server request with a paginated approach. The number of entries per Sitemap is still to be defined, performance will definitely be a deciding factor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The XML Sitemaps project has a clearly defined scope. The initial implementation will not include features like image, video, or news sitemaps. It also will not include a UI for controls to exclude individual posts, pages, or custom post types from the sitemap. This is somewhat controversial but plugins can always extend core to offer these features until a more sophisticated version of sitemaps lands in core.</p>\n<p>Plugin authors who offer XML sitemaps will need to re-architect their plugins with the new API in order to avoid conflicts and indexing errors. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I can confidently say that we will make it as smooth as possible and work with plugin authors to avoid conflicts,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;If anything else, having XML Sitemaps as well as a Core API to extend it will make their lives easier &#8211; plugin authors will have a standard way to extend it.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This effort to get sitemaps added to WordPress core is not limited to those working at Google and Yoast. Muller encouraged authors of other XML sitemaps plugins to get involved or at least follow the project&#8217;s development to ensure their plugins are compatible once it is merged into core.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 03:49:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2.2 Squashes 13 Bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-2-squashes-13-bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1305:\"<p>WordPress 5.2.2 dubbed a short-cycle maintenance release is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/06/wordpress-5-2-2-maintenance-release/\">available for download</a>.

Just Tadlock has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">proposed a idea</a> he calls Theme Feature Repositories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to create standardized packages on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT\">Theme Review Team GitHub</a> repo that authors could use in their themes. If enough people bought into the idea and worked together, it would lessen the pain points between reviewers and theme authors. It would also decrease the amount of code written by hundreds of different authors to solve a common problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock used Admin notices and Links to &#8216;Pro&#8217; versions as two examples that could benefit from this approach. Packages would handle specific use cases and be installed using Composer. For those who don&#8217;t use composer, an autoloader would be provided as well as a .zip file that could be dropped into a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock is asking the theme community what packages do they need or what common problems could be solved together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This can literally be any common feature in WordPress themes, not just admin or customizer-related things,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Nothing is &#8216;out of bounds&#8217;. Every idea is on the table right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is an ambitious project.  It’d require cooperation between authors and reviewers for the betterment of the theme directory as a whole. It’ll only work if we have buy-in from everyone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock also mentioned that due to his schedule, he will be unable to lead or co-lead the project and is seeking people interested in taking on these roles. Those interested should have knowledge of Git, Composer, and Object-oriented programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this project or want to provide feedback, you can leave a comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">the proposal</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:07:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: WordPress Spanish Translation Team Now has Meta Sites, Apps, and Top 200 Plugins 100% Translated\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90804\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-spanish-translation-team-now-has-meta-sites-apps-and-top-200-plugins-100-translated\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5640:\"<p>The Spanish WordPress community hit a remarkable milestone with translations this week.

According to stats Naoko Takano shared at <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-translation-day-4-successfully-hosts-77-local-events-in-35-countries-recruits-183-new-translators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Translation Day 4</a> last month, Spanish is the locale with the most translation contributors (2,863), followed by German (2,399), Italian (2,190), Dutch (1,584), and Russian (1,515). It is also one of the top non-English locales installed, with 5.0% of all WordPress sites using the translation. WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> similar numbers, where Spanish is the second most popular language for blogs at 4.7%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/_dorsvenabili/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rocío Valdivia</a>, a Community Wrangler at WordCamp Central who lives in Spain, gave us a look at what is behind the team&#8217;s extraordinary growth and momentum. She identified several key factors that have contributed to their success in working efficiently and sharing useful information among team members during the past 2-3 years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a Slack instance some years ago, but at the beginning it was common for people to join and ask for support questions,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;Now we have some protocols: the general channel is an only-read channel. If someone ask for support, we send them with a kind predef to the <a href=\"https://es.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">es.wordpress.org</a> forums, where they get answers in a few hours. There are no questions in the forums waiting for longer than six hours ever, as we have a very active support team that coordinates in the #support channel of our Slack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Valdivia said that removing the noise of support requests has given the team very productive channels for translations, plugin and theme translations, meetups (where Meetup organizers share tips and resources using a shared Google drive folder), and WordCamps (where WC organizers share info, tips, answer questions in Spanish, and share resources like email templates.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides all of this, we’ve worked very well passing the philosophy of the project to the new members from the most experienced ones,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;For example, people do very soft transitions from one lead organizer to the next one.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Although some WordCamp attendees have complained in the past that not much is accomplished at Contributor Days, the Spanish community has had success using these opportunities to transfer knowledge to new leaders and contributors. The community hosted 10 WordCamps in 2018 and Valdivia estimates they will have 9-10 in 2019. WordCamp Barcelona 2018 and 2019 had 400 attendees and 180 people at their Contributor Days. WC Irun 2019 had 220 attendees and 100 participants at Contributor Day. WordCamp Madrid 2019 sold out with 600 attendees and approximately 200 participated in Contributor Day.</p>\n<p>Although the Spanish community has experienced contributors across several WordPress.org teams, such as WPTV, Community, Support, and Polyglots, Valdivia said they are a bit thin on Core contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re lacking people with experience contributing frequently to Core,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;We have some of them who have contributed several times, but still need more people with more involvement to be able to pass all this info to newcomers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Strong local meetups are another factor in the Spanish community&#8217;s success at keeping translations up-to-date. In addition to the largest team of translators in the world of WordPress, Spain has the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/reports/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second highest number of meetup groups</a> and events per month. Spain is running 64 local meetups, with a population of 46 million people, compared to 201 groups in the U.S., which has 7x the population size (327 million).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-2.20.46-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The language barrier has been an issue for years, as not everyone speaks English and not everyone feels confident following conversations in English,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;So, being able to train our own teams of contributors in our own language and having our own shared resources and channels, has been very useful.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:22:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 356 – Gutenberg, Governance, and Contributing to WordPress with Jonny Harris\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90817&preview=true&preview_id=90817\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-356-gutenberg-governance-and-contributing-to-wordpress-with-jonny-harris\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1955:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://www.spacedmonkey.com/\">Jonny Harris</a>.

Schott&#8217;s mission with Pika is &#8220;to make modern JavaScript more accessible by making it easier to find, publish, install, and use modern packages on npm.&#8221; Pika provides a searchable catalog of &#8220;module&#8221; packages available on npm &#8211; packages that use the more compact ES module syntax (ESM), which result in smaller Javascript bundles. </p>\n<p>npm currently lists <a href=\"https://www.pika.dev/about/stats\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">59,851 ES modules</a>. This makes up approximately 7% of total packages on npm are exporting an ES module, but the number is steadily increasing: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-9.13.09-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Pika makes it easy to search for these packages and the results will only include those that have a defined &#8220;module&#8221; entry point in their package.json manifest. Each listing consolidates the relevant information on one page, highlighting the important details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-9.26.36-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One of the chief advantages of using ES modules is that they run natively on the web, without the need for a bundler. In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.pikapkg.com/blog/pika-web-a-future-without-webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Future Without Webpack</a>,&#8221; Schott contends that JavaScript developers are &#8220;so steeped in the world of bundlers&#8221; that they overlook the possibilities of using ESM dependencies that run directly on the web:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last several years, JavaScript bundling has morphed from a production-only optimization into a required build step for most web applications. Whether you love this or hate it, it’s hard to deny that bundlers have added a ton of new complexity to web development – a field of development that has always taken pride in its view-source, easy-to-get-started ethos.</p>\n<p>@pika/web is an attempt to free web development from the bundler requirement. In 2019, you should use a bundler because you want to, not because you need to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schott created <a href=\"https://github.com/pikapkg/web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> @pika/web</a> to make it easy for developers to use ES modules, even when they don&#8217;t have compatible dependencies. It provides an install-time tool that is not exactly a build tool or a bundler but works to output web-native npm dependencies into a single ESM .js file:</p>\n<blockquote><p>@pika/web checks your package.json manifest for any &#8220;dependencies&#8221; that export a valid ESM “module” entry point, and then installs them to a local web_modules/ directory. @pika/web works on any ESM package, even ones with ESM &#038; Common.js internal dependencies.</p>\n<p>Installed packages run in the browser because @pika/web bundles each package into a single, web-ready ESM .js file. For example: The entire “preact” package is installed to web_modules/preact.js. This takes care of anything bad that the package may be doing internally, while preserving the original package interface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a demo of how that works:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">¡OJO con @pika/web! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f440.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4e6.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Instala tus dependencias npm y úsalas directamente en el navegador.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sin bundlers, ni configuraciones de ningún tipo.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Nativo, ESM, optimizado para http2&#8230; ¡y MUY rápido!</p>\n<p>¡Muy pronto, vídeo más completo y artículo en <a href=\"https://t.co/uc7bPEkbXB\">https://t.co/uc7bPEkbXB</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"?‍?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />! <a href=\"https://t.co/cdNWqBnrDc\">pic.twitter.com/cdNWqBnrDc</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Miguel Ángel Durán <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"?‍?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@midudev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midudev/status/1101828172390248448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>This week Schott announced the availability of a new <a href=\"https://www.pika.dev/cdn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pika CDN</a> for delivering modern ES module packages. It uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/pikapkg/web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pikapkg/web package builder</a> to work with any ESM package and the CDN will automagically  handle any non-ESM dependencies of that package. Pika CDN automatically detects the visitor&#8217;s browser and serves JS that is optimized to the environment, eliminating polyfills and transpiler bloat wherever possible. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-10.12.32-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Pika CDN leverages your browser&#8217;s natural caching abilities to give your pages faster dependency load times, especially on first visit,&#8221; Schott said. &#8220;0ms first-loads are even possible (for your dependencies at least) if all packages have been seen before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With our CDN, package authors can distribute more modern, unminified packages without worrying about how to serve them directly. Instead, our nifty package-builder automatically resolves each package &#8212; and any legacy sub-dependencies &#8212; into a single, minified, ready-to-import JavaScript file.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schott recently left his position at Ripple to work full-time on Pika, a project that he believes will move the JavaScript ecosystem forward. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Leaving my team was one of the hardest decisions I&#8217;ve ever made, but I know that I&#8217;m needed here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m so excited to be a part of the future of the web, whatever it ends up looking like.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pika is looking for corporate sponsors.

Especially when it first came to video and they could watch it every day… or two or three times a day if mom wasn’t feeling good or catching up on sleep from being up with baby brother the night before.</p>\n<p>There’s this strange part of that movie where Moana follows Maui to a place under the ocean called “The Realm of Monsters.” It’s where monsters go after being killed. If you have younger kids, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. If you don’t have kids, it’s when the giant crab sings the song “Shiny.”</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>One common theme in myths, legends, and ancient religious writings, is where the hero visits the underworld, aka “afterlife” or “hell.” There they experience a symbolic or actual death for themselves or a loved one. Often through conquering a monster who is the Lord of the Underworld, they then re-emerge with their loved one, new knowledge and power, and/or some object to help them on their quest.</p>\n<p>The film Moana clearly plays out this theme. She and Maui emerge triumphant from the realm of monsters, having defeated the giant crab by flipping it on its back and retrieving Maui’s magical hook.</p>\n<p>In Return of the Jedi, Luke descends to the underworld of Jabba&#8217;s Palace. There, he’s able to bring his friend Han Solo back from a virtual death, defeat the Rancor, kill Jabba the Hut (lord of the criminal underworld), save the princess, and retrieve his lightsaber. All this happens before we see even one single, fuzzy, cute, unblinking Ewok…. Unless you believe in the “special editions,” in which case the Ewoks blink.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>There are many movies, books, stories, mythologies, etc that all follow similar patterns.</p>\n<p>Like Maui’s hook or Luke’s lightsaber, in these stories the hero often emerges from the underworld with newfound knowledge and/or a powerful object. Briefly, I’d like to take you on my own personal “Hero’s Journey” to the dark underworld of WordPress hosting. Along with it my quest of building a business on WordPress and hosting, with its own mythical monsters to slay, trials to be conquered, riddles to be solved, and ultimately new knowledge and weapons gained.</p>\n<h3>The Call to Adventure</h3>\n<p>In the early days of my business, Fiddler Online (<a href=\"https://wordx.press/what-the-change-to-wordxpress-means-for-our-members/\">now called WordXpress</a>), I envisioned building websites for companies on WordPress, then charging a monthly fee to maintain, support, edit, update, and manage them. I got started with a few clients and wanted to grow.</p>\n<p>I’d trusted someone to set me up with a very inexpensive VPS on unmanaged hosting. He was supposed to do the managing and ensure it all ran smoothly. I quickly learned you get what you pay for! Soon our members’ sites started going offline, usually all at once as the VPS crashed from one problem or another. It wasn’t just the server being down that caused problems. It was also corrupting data and other strange and scary things that I’d never encountered before, such as the body content of posts and pages being cut off, starting with the first special character that appeared in the content (a database issue).</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>These were dark and scary monsters to battle. I knew cPanel pretty well, but the APACHE stack that ran beneath it was mostly a mystery to me. So was database encoding and other advanced technical realms that all have an impact on the server, WordPress, and ultimately our clients’ businesses.</p>\n<p>The monsters appeared, seemingly determined to kill my small and struggling business, shortly after the birth of our first child. I was frequently up all night working with “Todd” the server guy (we’ll call him) to try and get the websites back online. We’d vanquish one monster, rest a day or so, and find another had taken some sites down again.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of constant frustration, I said “enough” and signed up for a Hostgator reseller plan. This was back when they were an independent hosting company. On this new plan I could install as many cPanel’s as I needed and manage each separately! I thought it was wonderful and would solve all my problems. Hostgator transferred all our sites from the terrible VPS hosting we’d been on to their servers and I thought perhaps that was it!</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought my quest was over. I’d fought the monsters and won.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scary as it was, it had been relatively brief. I’d learned a lot, but felt like I’d been to the underworld and back!</p>\n<h3>The Illusion of Safety</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the wraiths had cast a spell over me, blinding me to the fact that they were still lurking in the shadows. When transferring our WordPress websites to our new account, Hostgator had copied each entire cPanel over from the VPS. This eliminated the underlying problems in the APACHE stack on that horrible VPS, but brought with it the fiends that had infiltrated cPanel and even our WordPress websites. To be clear: they weren’t infected with any kind of malware, but configuration problems, cruft, and who knows what else, caused some really bad results.</p>\n<p>With my new spellbound, but misled confidence, I pushed our business forward. I brought on a business partner, Kurt as the sales guy. Later we acquired another website company. Through all that, we’d learned a lot, and doing okay for that stage, but still struggled financially as we bootstrapped this new business from nothing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we acquired this other business, they’d been running all their client’s sites on WordPress Multisite. It seemed like a great idea because of how it allowed us to manage all the websites in one place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the progress the business made, the monstrosities emerged again and this time with higher stakes since our business had grown and was now managing many more websites. These monsters emerged partly from what had been transferred over with cPanel, and the difficulties of running a large Multisite where each child site had its own theme, plus the weight of adding more and more websites and traffic to hosting that was really just shared hosting with WHM access and more control.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>The Plunge Into the Underworld</h3>\n<p>In each hero’s journey, there’s often a wizard or goddess that helps guide and mentor the hero along his journey. I eventually made friends with a great guy we’ll call Sam. He ran his own hosting company with data centers and a great support staff. Sam was somewhat like Obi-Wan, Merlin, or Maui in these stories: he was my mentor and companion on my adventures into the underworld that followed. He made a great guide, because he’d been there before. Unfortunately, his own journey had never taken him to some of the deepest darkest places we would soon encounter.</p>\n<p>So we moved to Sam’s hosting, where he kindly watched things closely and provided a server admin’s perspective and advice at a much lower price than he would have normally charged.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long before the demons, wraiths, monsters, and other ghouls started crawling from the darkness. It started with random downtime. Then followed strange limitations on websites. Next emails were not getting delivered. Then it was slowness. Now we were hacked… or were we? Suddenly all the contents of all pages and posts were cut off (we thought we killed this monster before)! Then email wasn’t being sent. Next our server is sending spam email. Now a hard drive is dying. It just kept going and going. Many of these demons were completely new to Sam and his very experienced team.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before there were whisperings of “the Fiddler curse.” This curse referred to Fiddler Online the name of our company. The hosting support team joked that we were cursed. All kinds of issues arose that they’d never seen before, and with a frequency they’d never experienced either.</p>\n<p>When a car crashed into the data center’s power regulation center during a freak storm, it cut off power from the normal power lines, as well as from their automatic backup power supply! It completely took the data center offline. The “Fiddler curse” was in full force.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Or put better, we were in the deepest, darkest, part of the underworld, locked in an all-out battle with the worst demons and wraiths it had to send against us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We tried method after method to defeat the monsters. We tried rebuilding the server stacks. We tried various WordPress optimizations. We bought our own server and had it installed in their data center. We even tried a totally different Linux stack and something called Interworx, a cPanel alternative, that came with load balancing and real-time backup. But no matter how much money, time, and knowledge we threw at it, the issues continued. No matter how many monsters we slew, we were still losing the war.</p>\n<h3>The “Real World” Dragons</h3>\n<p>When I recently asked my wife Jill about that time of our lives, she said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From my perspective, it was hard to know when to throw in the towel and say ‘enough’ because it’s just not working. Getting the hosting sorted out totally changed the entire dynamic and perspective of doing our own business. Before that, it felt like we were building a dream on a crumbling foundation.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>And don’t get the wrong idea from this image. Jill was no damsel in distress. She’s a warrior too. I’d have never completed this quest without her there, fighting alongside me. She may have not fought the technical fiends, but there were plenty other monsters in the form of financial struggles, moves, and difficult situations that arose from my unavailability, our lack of money, and more.</p>\n<p>This was all a lot like battling the Hydra of Lerna: we’d cut off one head, and two would grow back in its place. We’d take a breather for a week, and then here came the wraiths!</p>\n<p>The stress of it all exacerbated a gallstone problem I had. Because of a misdiagnosis, I thought it was something there was no solution for. So even when I wasn’t up in the middle of the night battling monsters demons of the hosting underworld with Sam, I was often awake at night in massive amounts of pain as my gallbladder tried to pass gigantic gallstones. So even then, I’d be sleeping the next day when I needed to be designing websites or networking.</p>\n<p>Throw in a healthy dose of anxiety and some intermittent depression and you get the picture. Instead of growing, our business stagnated. The quest through this dark underworld seemed to have no end in sight. It ruined vacations, stole away family time, punished me physically, hurt our client’s business, and was pushing myself, Jill, and our finances, to our very limits.</p>\n<h3>Death and Rebirth</h3>\n<p>It all seemed to come to a head when the pain of my gallstones became so intense I thought I was going to die. After 2 visits to the Emergency Room and 3 days in the hospital, I gave birth to this baby. They actually saw a larger one than this in the ultrasound beforehand, but my body had apparently broken it up before they removed my gallbladder. I returned home with real-world wounds that would turn into scars, and lighter by one gallbladder and several massive gallstones.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>I left the hospital with a new lease on life. I felt like I’d been resurrected, fighting my way out of the underworld and back to the land of the living. It helped me open up to a completely different approach to hosting and allowed me to see that tiny speck of light that ended up being the doorway out of this underworld made up of the dark side of WordPress and hosting.</p>\n<p>I was able to use my newfound perspective to find some awesome new weapons, and fight my way to that exit. Luckily for you, you can learn from my pain and battles with the underworld.</p>\n<h3>The Road Back: Simplify</h3>\n<p>Illumination was mine! Of the knowledge I gained, one key principle stood out among the rest: <strong>make things as simple as possible, while avoiding single points of failure on mission-critical systems.</strong> Multisite was great for managing all the websites at once, but if one had a problem, they all went down! The same with having a single server to run all our sites: if the server went down, we had the urgency of 30 or 40 clients (back then) all being negatively impacted at once.</p>\n<p>We started by <a href=\"https://wordx.press/how-to-revert-a-wordpress-multisite-to-a-single-site/\">killing our Multisites</a> and traditional hosting setups. Instead of a single Multisite with 1 database where a problem could take down all the sites in the Multisite, we moved to individual WordPress installs for each site. As we pulled each site out of the Multisite and migrated it to our new cloud hosting, we also checked the databases and files thoroughly to ensure they were clean, light, and that we eliminated any cruft that had built up in the database. We also stopped running email and DNS through our web servers. This effectively killed the demons that had moved with us in previous hosting migrations.</p>\n<p>Here’s my recommended do’s and don&#8217;ts for any smaller businesses hosting and maintaining WordPress websites:</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use shared hosting or hosting that uses cPanel</li>\n<li>use Multisite (SPoF)</li>\n<li>put all your sites on 1 server (SPoF)</li>\n<li>use your web server as an email server</li>\n<li>send WordPress transactional emails from your webserver</li>\n<li>use your web server for DNS</li>\n<li>use your hosting company for domain registration</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use cloud hosting with WordPress-optimized stack and custom control panel</li>\n<li>use a bulk-site-management tool</li>\n<li>spread your sites across multiple servers</li>\n<li>use an email suite (Hover, Zoho, G Suite, Office 365)</li>\n<li>use a transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark, MailGun)</li>\n<li>use your registrar for DNS</li>\n<li>use a different registrar for registering domains, than your hosting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following these tips eliminates many single points of failure, simplifies things greatly, and gives you the tools and ability to go right to the source of the problem. Since all your important WordPress functionality isn’t in one place with one point of failure, you can go where the problem is.</p>\n<p>For example, if a client isn’t receiving WooCommerce new order emails from their website, we can quickly go to SendGrid to see why that is and what needs to be done to fix it in an easy to use interface. Try that on a traditional APACHE/cPanel setup that sends your client’s company emails, WordPress emails, etc. all from one place.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>\n<p>We eliminated cPanel and the normal Linux hosting stacks by <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/tevya-wordxpress-success-story/\">moving to CloudWays</a>, which has a nice WordPress setup that they run on top of a number of cloud hosting services such as Google, Amazon, Digital Ocean, and Vultr. They have their own in-house customized stack and management dashboard. CloudWays removed all the normal bloat and potential for problems that comes with it, and really took away most of the pain, hassle, and responsibility of the hosting part of WordPress and for quite cheap.</p>\n<p>On CloudWays, instead of putting all 40+ sites on one server, we split them up, with about 15 &#8211; 18 sites on one small Digital Ocean (and later Vultr) server. This meant that if one site had issues, it wouldn’t take down all our other sites. And even if the issue was bad enough to affect the whole server, or the server had its own issues, only a small portion of our clients would be affected at once.</p>\n<h3>Email Accounts and Transactional Email</h3>\n<p>Additionally, we stopped running email through our servers. Part of simplifying is outsourcing to people/services who can just do it better than you (or that old hosting you’re clinging to because it’s cheap). I love that good WordPress hosts like CloudWays, Flywheel, and Kinsta have no options for you to do this or include built-in services like SendGrid. I slew a lot of email monsters. Using something like SendGrid or Postmark for WordPress and G Suite or Office 365 for email accounts, eliminates tons of headaches.</p>\n<p>We set up WordPress’s emails to go through SendGrid and all our members’ email accounts we migrated to Hover, Google Apps, or Office 365.</p>\n<h3>Bulk-WordPress Management</h3>\n<p>In place of Multisite, we found MainWP and chose it over other options like InfiniteWP. It provided us the bulk-control of Multisite, but without the single point of failure issue. The upside is that it’s fairly inexpensive and runs on a WordPress install, so you control it on your hosting.</p>\n<p>That’s kinda its downside as well. If something goes wrong, it’s on my team and I to run the problem down and fix it. Or we have to go through the cumbersome process of reporting it to the MainWP support team, then providing them access to both the dashboard site and an affected child site. Eventually we decided to move to ManageWP because it’s a hosted platform. That means when something goes wrong, much of the time, it’s on them to fix, and they have access to fix their own platform, plus the logs, etc from our sites.</p>\n<p><strong>MainWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Runs on top of your WP install</li>\n<li>You maintain control</li>\n<li>Familiar interface</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Lifetime extensions purchase option</li>\n<li>GPL licensed</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n<li>Good community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ManageWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More expensive</li>\n<li>Runs on their servers, so problems are largely theirs to deal with</li>\n<li>Less overall responsibility and time drain</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Master of Two Worlds of WordPress</h3>\n<p>Fortunately today there are many awesome hosting options and bulk-management tools that simply weren’t available to me years ago when I started on this journey. After this last, final push, my team and I stood back and waited and rested, expecting more monsters. And occasionally one crawled out of it’s hole. But by and large the underworld was defeated and left far behind. Moving to cloud hosting and simplifying were finally the spell that broke the Fiddler curse and freed us from the underworld. Our business’s core service was stable and safe and running like it should be. We could start growing again! It was such a relief!</p>\n<p>To reiterate some of the illumination gained on my journey: simplify your WordPress websites and hosting through offloading everything you can to experts who do it better, often for cheaper (if you properly calculate the value of your own time). Focus on your super-power whether it be design or development, or just creating solutions on WP with existing plugins and tools. If your super-power isn’t WordPress at all, you can outsource maintenance, content updates, backups and security, plugin and core updates, and much more to a company like <a href=\"https://wordx.press\">WordXpress</a>. I’ve built this company based on the knowledge and tools I learned on my quest.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=My%20%22Hero%27s%20Journey%22%20Through%20the%20Dark%20Underworld%20of%20WordPress%20Hosting&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F&title=My+%26%238220%3BHero%26%238217%3Bs+Journey%26%238221%3B+Through+the+Dark+Underworld+of+WordPress+Hosting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\" title=\"My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\">My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Tevya Washburn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Drupal Gutenberg 1.0 Released, Now Ready for Production Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90376\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-gutenberg-1-0-released-now-ready-for-production-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6201:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg module for Drupal</a>, created by <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, reached the 1.0 milestone earlier this month. It is the first stable release recommended for use in production with Drupal 8.x. </p>\n<p>The 1.0 release removes the Gutenberg-JS dependency and uses Gutenberg core files directly. It is based on Gutenberg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-1st-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 5.6.1</a>, which was released in early May. The module boasts better handling for media files, adding support for title, caption, and alternative text. It also adds an &#8220;Allowed Blocks UI&#8221; to the content type admin UI, so administrators can restrict which blocks show up in the block selector.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re now ready for production sites in the sense that we’ll be more careful with structure changes, will try to do update paths when possible, and will create automated tests for crucial functionality,&#8221; Frontkom project manager Thor Andre Gretland said. &#8220;We’ve solved the blockers for a stable release.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Upgrading the module from RC-1 may require some extra steps, because it is a big jump, taking the Gutenberg library from 4.8.0 to 5.6.1. Users will need to update the database. It is also necessary to navigate to content types and click save to enable Gutenberg again so that it will begin storing the Allowed blocks in the database. If users get notices about invalid blocks, they are advised to try the Attempt Block Recovery option:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/attempt-block-recovery.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s actually a rather large update,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;We were planning to add a couple of last needed features to release our 1.0 version, but ended up using the latest Gutenberg version with several new great features. We’re also using more of the Gutenberg Core, that we’ve been able to use before.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The module still has one critical issue that Frontkom is working on. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3059167\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reusable blocks are not working</a> with the latest release. Users are getting a &#8220;this block is unavailable or deleted&#8221; message when attempting to insert a reusable block. In the meantime, those who require this feature can roll back to RC1 to get it working again.</p>\n<p>So far the Gutenberg module has been well-received. It has been downloaded more than 12,000 times and 494 sites are reported to be using it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Setup <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalgutenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@drupalgutenberg</a> on D8 yesterday (following meeting one of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frontkom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@frontkom</a> at the recent Dutch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CiviCRM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CiviCRM</a> sprint) and was pretty blown away.

Although the library has been slow to gain contributors, it does contain several blocks that are helpful for creating page layouts, such as Content in Columns, Hero Section, Section Wrapper, Section Row, and a Feature Box block. Site administrators can also use the Gutenberg module in combination with Drupal&#8217;s new Layout Builder, which was introduced as a stable module to Drupal 8.7 core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see a valid use case for mixing Drupal Gutenberg with the Drupal layout builder when you might want to create layout templates with the layout builder, and keep the actual content editing in Gutenberg,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;For example you could use the layout builder to define fixed byline elements for author and create date, but leave the actual content creation experience to Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a few limitations to using the two tools together. The only way to use them on the same project is if they deal with different content types.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Drupal Gutenberg takes over the whole node UI, it can have some unexpected effects when used together with Layout Builder,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;That doesn’t mean that they won’t ever &#8216;work&#8217; together. One idea could be using the LB data structure to generate Gutenberg fixed layouts/templates and even save Gutenberg data in a structured way handled by Layout Builder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gretland said his team believes Gutenberg delivers a better editing experience than Layout Builder, as it is a more mature project. However, Layout Builder stores its data in a structured way, which has its advantages and disadvantages over Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>WebWash has a good <a href=\"https://www.webwash.net/create-pages-using-gutenberg-wordpress-editor-in-drupal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video tutorial</a> for Drupal users who want to learn how to configure the Gutenberg module and use it on the Page content type.

DevKit gives me the power to do that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallings added, &#8220;We wanted to build a kick ass set of tools for developers building on WP Engine. That’s been our mission from the start, build something that all developers want to use (including us)!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As what for what sets DevKit apart from the others, &#8220;I think our architecture is very different from both tools,&#8221; Stallings said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Similar to Docker Engine, DevKit CLI is the interface to DevKit. So when we build the GUI it will 100% complement the CLI, and the two can be used interchangeably. This will enable us to build other interfaces in the future too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DevKit provides the following features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Container-based local development environment</li><li>SSH Gateway access</li><li>Push and pull deployments to WP Engine</li><li>Preview your local site with others via ngrok</li><li>PHP version selector</li><li>Email testing client</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Local SSH &amp; WP-CLI</li><li>Genesis Framework WP-CLI commands</li><li>phpmyadmin</li><li>webgrind</li><li>Varnish</li><li>HTTPS Proxy</li><li>xdebug</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, DevKit&#8217;s user interface is command line only with plans to add a GUI later this year. It&#8217;s available for free and is in open beta for Mac and Linux.

Although centralization has some advantages for usability and reliability, success can be expensive when a centralized service becomes popular. She described the events leading up to npm&#8217;s incorporation in 2013. The registry was down more than it was up in October 2013 and npm needed money.</p>\n<p>npm&#8217;s owner took seed funding from a VC firm and the Node project continued to give npm special privileges. Developers perpetuated this by continuing to use npm, as over time it had come to define developers&#8217; expectations in serving JavaScript packages. Silverio discusses some of the consequences of npm coming under private control, how developers now have no input into registry policies or how disputes are resolved. </p>\n<p>Presumably speaking from her intimate knowledge of the company&#8217;s inner workings, Silverio describes how VC-funding turned npm Inc. into a financial instrument.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Financial instruments are contracts about money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;npm Inc, the company that owns our language ecosystem, is a thing that might as well be a collection of pork bellies, as far as its owners are concerned. They make contracts with each other and trade bits of it around. npm Inc. is a means for turning money into more money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio contends that JavaScript&#8217;s package registry should not be privately controlled and that centralization is a burden that will inevitably lead to private control because the servers cost money. </p>\n<p>Her sharp criticism of centralized package management leads into her announcement of a federated, decentralized package registry called <a href=\"https://github.com/entropic-dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Entropic</a> that she created with former npm colleague Chris Dickinson and more than a dozen contributors. The project is Apache 2.0 licensed and its creators are working in cooperation with the <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OpenJS Foundation</a>. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Warming my heart right now: how many former npm-ers are contributing to entropic &lt;3</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ceej is on vacation (@ceejbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceejbot/status/1136551537835032577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Entropic comes with its own CLI, and offers a new file-centric publication API. All packages published to the registry are public and developers are encouraged to use something like the GitHub Package Registry if they need to control access to packages. The project is just over a month old and is not ready for use. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it’s right that the pendulum is swinging away from centralization and I want to lend my push to the swing,&#8221; Silverio said. The last decade has been about consolidation and monolithic services, but the coming decade is going to be federated. Federation spreads out costs. It spreads out control. It spreads out policy-making. It hands control of your slice of our language ecosystem to you. My hope is that by giving Entropic away, I’ll help us take our language commons back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management/blob/master/essay.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Economics of Package Management</a> essay is available on GitHub. Check out the video of the presentation from JSConf EU below. If decentralized package management gains momentum and becomes the standard for the industry, this video captures what may become a turning point in the JavaScript ecosystem and a defining moment for the future of the web.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 03:41:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 5.0 to Update Password Control to Match WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-update-password-control-to-match-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3462:\"<p>BuddyPress 5.0 development began in December 2018 after <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2018/11/buddypress-4-0-0-pequod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4.0.0 was released</a> in November. The core BuddyPress team has not published a roadmap for what will be coming in 5.0, but features and fixes added so far can be found on GitHub in the <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/BuddyPress/commits/master\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commit log</a>. </p>\n<p>One noteworthy addition to the upcoming major release is that the BP Nouveau template pack is being <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12397\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated to use the same password control as the one used in WordPress core</a>. BuddyPress users will now be able to set their passwords using WordPress&#8217; interface on the registration page and on the user&#8217;s general settings page. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it will look like in the templates:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\'s how it looks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4fd.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/g8DknNpUKl\">pic.twitter.com/g8DknNpUKl</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; imath (@imath) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imath/status/1129668922024845313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>By default, BuddyPress will generate a strong password, but the user can still edit it, if necessary.

As a result of the password control update, the src/bp-templates/bp-nouveau/js/password-verify.js template is scheduled to be deprecated and deleted in BuddyPress 6.0.0, so developers will want to take note if using the bp-nouveau-password-verify script as a dependency for custom password control implementations.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress 5.0 also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-display-debug-info-in-the-new-site-health-info-screen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adds BP-specific debug into to the Site Health Info screen</a> that was introduced in WordPress 5.2.

But, this is an extremely powerful feature that I’m sure will become more useful in the future. I can even see things like theme authors sharing reusable blocks to help users build out certain page designs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing other people share their reusable blocks or templates. One of the beautiful things about the new editor is that it doesn&#8217;t require a developer to sort blocks into a particular layout and then save it as a reusable block that can be shared.</p>\n<h2>C02 May Be the Cause of Feeling Drowsy During Conference Sessions</h2>\n<p>I always thought it had something to do with lunch but I&#8217;ve felt drowsy before then.

For example, some of the information in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/wordpress-weekly\">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/icymi\">In Case You Missed It</a> posts never changes and instead of manually entering it each time, it&#8217;s nice to use a template where only a few changes are necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other day, I was wondering if I could use the reusable block feature in Gutenberg to replace the plugin. Justin Tadlock reached out and provided me a reusable block template JSON file that I imported into Gutenberg. By the way, if you successfully import a block into WordPress, the block won&#8217;t appear until you manually refresh the page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reusable block template approach works fairly well. However, I noticed that I was unable to add a block inside the reusable block. When I tried, a red line was displayed and any blocks that were inserted were removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Red Means No</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that reusable blocks are meant to be restricted templates where changes are distributed across a site to wherever the block is displayed. But it&#8217;s still a bummer that I can&#8217;t add a block inside the template for a singular purpose if a need arises. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing I noticed is that reusable blocks are custom post types. While there is a link to manage them within the reusable block selector, there isn&#8217;t a dedicated item within the admin menu. Unless you know the location of the management link, adding and managing them can be a bit more time-consuming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a quick shortcut to the reusable block management screen, add this to the URL after your domain name. wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I&#8217;ll experiment with reusable blocks a bit more but as long as they&#8217;re not changing often, I believe they&#8217;ll make a nice replacement for the Post Templates plugin. What use cases have you encountered where reusable blocks were the solution?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 02:13:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Branch Continuous Integration Service Selected for TinySeed Startup Accelerator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90611\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/branch-continuous-integration-service-selected-for-tinyseed-startup-accelerator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4298:\"<p><a href=\"https://branchci.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Branch</a>, a Docker-based continuous integration service for WordPress, has been selected for <a href=\"https://tinyseed.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TinySeed&#8217;s startup accelerator</a>. The company was founded by Peter Suhm who is also the creator of <a href=\"https://wppusher.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a>, a plugin that lets developers install and update WordPress themes and plugins directly from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.</p>\n<p>TinySeed, founded by <a href=\"https://robwalling.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Walling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vollset.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Einar Vollset</a>, is a remote accelerator that focuses on providing enough funding for early-stage SaaS founders to live for a year and focus full-time on their startups. It advertises itself as &#8220;the first startup accelerator designed for bootstrappers.&#8221; TinySeed is unique in that it does not have a bias against single founders. The website states that the majority of successful $1m-$30m SaaS companies that TinySeed is connected with were started by founders working alone. </p>\n<p>Branch fits the bill as a SaaS company with a single founder and no employees. As part of the investment terms, TinySeed invests $120k for the first founder (plus $20k per additional founder) in exchange for 8-15% equity. If founders do not need the money for living expenses they are free to spend it on growing the business. Both Branch and WP Pusher are included in Suhm&#8217;s participation in TinySeed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Pusher was doing just enough to pay my bills living in a fairly cheap city (Glasgow), but not enough to pay a full time developer salary,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;However, I didn&#8217;t spend much time on WP Pusher in the past few years and was working part time for other companies &#8211; mainly <a href=\"https://www.timekit.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Timekit</a> as a backend developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm said the TinySeed investment will allow him to work full time on Branch and WP Pusher for at least a year or two without having to worry about making a salary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I may also decide to make a hire during the program, but I want the product to be a little bit more mature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In terms of the roadmap, I&#8217;ll be able to focus more on building the best tool and less about making a lot of money in the beginning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Branch and WP Pusher are fairly unique products in the WordPress space. Suhm said he sees most of his competition coming from continuous integration services that are not tailored to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, my biggest competitor at the moment is probably manual labor &#8211; WordPress developers testing and deploying everything manually,&#8221; Suhm said.</p>\n<p>TinySeed received approximately 900 applications from which they will select 10-15 companies for participation in 2019. Co-founder Rob Walling has knowledge of the WordPress ecosystem, as he previously <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-closes-1-2m-in-series-a-financing/\">invested in WP Engine&#8217;s 2011 round of funding</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Peter has a distinct advantage with Branch in that he&#8217;s building on the audience, customer base, and domain knowledge he&#8217;s developed with WP Pusher,&#8221; TinySeed co-founder Rob Walling said. &#8220;His methodical approach to shipping code and content every week has been a good signal for us that he&#8217;s pushing the product forward, as well as a key factor in building Branch&#8217;s traction in the space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Branch is joining a handful of other SaaS companies that have already been selected for 2019, including <a href=\"https://clientsherpa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ClientSherpa</a>, <a href=\"https://gatherit.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gather</a>, <a href=\"https://simsaas.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SimSaaS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reimbi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reimbi</a>, and <a href=\"https://castos.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Castos</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:31:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: Automattic Adopts Alex Mills’ Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90583\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-adopts-alex-mills-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4656:\"<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/taking-care-of-alexs-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that a team inside the company will be adopting <a href=\"https://alex.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Mills</a>&#8216; plugins and continuing their development and support. Mills, also known around the web as @Viper007Bond, was a WordPress core contributor and prolific plugin developer who passed away in February 2019 after a battle with Leukemia. </p>\n<p>At one time last year, Mills was the primary author for and contributor to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181231163744/https://profiles.wordpress.org/viper007bond/#content-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 40 plugins</a> hosted on WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/viper007bond/#content-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">current collection</a> seems to have been pared back to 17 of his most popular plugins. According to <a href=\"http://wptally.com/?wpusername=viper007bond\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stats from WP Tally</a>, these 17 plugins have a cumulative download count of 138,665,603 and a cumulative rating of 4.55 out of 5 stars.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since all of my plugins are open-source, they are free to be forked by reputable authors in the WordPress community. It would mean a lot to have my legacy go on,&#8221; Mills said in his <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/18/leukemia-has-won/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">farewell post</a> earlier this year. The plugins are all free without any pro versions or monetization efforts attached to them.</p>\n<p>“I’d never monetize any of my plugins,” Mills told the Tavern after his popular Regenerate Thumbnails plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/regenerate-thumbnails-plugin-passes-5-million-downloads-rewrite-in-the-works\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed 5 million downloads</a> in 2017. “I write them for fun not profit. It would be a conflict of interest anyway due to my employment at Automattic.”</p>\n<p>Regenerate Thumbnails is active on more than a million WordPress sites and <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/01/29/my-regenerate-thumbnails-plugin-passes-10m-downloads/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed the 10 million downloads milestone</a> in January 2019. It has already been downloaded more than 7,000 times today and has regularly received 3K-12k downloads per day throughout 2019. </p>\n<p>The enduring popularity of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> is a testament to Mills&#8217; commitment to writing future-proof plugins. What started as a small plugin to fix a client&#8217;s problem in 2008 quickly became an indispensable utility for millions of WordPress users transitioning between themes with different image sizes. For those users who could never write their own script to generate new thumbnail sizes, Mills&#8217; plugin was a little piece of time-saving magic that exemplifies the significant contributions plugin developers can make when they write and share code that solves a common problem.</p>\n<p>Automattic plans to fork each of Mills&#8217; GitHub repositories and will add them to the Automattic Github account. The team behind this effort is also adding the following paragraph to each plugin&#8217;s readme file:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In February 2019 Alex Mills, the author of this plugin, <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/27/from-alexs-family/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed away</a>. He leaves behind a number of plugins which will be maintained by Automattic and members of the WordPress community. If this plugin is useful to you please consider <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/03/13/in-memory-of-alex-donation-link-update/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">donating to the Oregon Health and Science University</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic will also be answering support queries on the forums and the team is open to receiving help from other members of the WordPress community in maintaining and supporting Mills&#8217; plugins. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In times gone by authors left works of music, novels, poetry, and letters on their passing,&#8221; Donncha Ó Caoimh said on the Automattic Engineering blog. &#8220;They were static works of art frozen in time. Alex leaves behind his code that will continue to evolve and operate in a living world used by thousands (millions?) of people every day as they go about their online lives.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Jun 2019 16:51:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 355 – Food Poisoning Is No Joke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90569&preview=true&preview_id=90569\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-355-food-poisoning-is-no-joke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1676:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss Joost de Valk&#8217;s decision to step down as WordPress&#8217; Marketing Lead.

Site owners can select &#8220;Googlebot Smartphone&#8221; as the user-agent on the rich results testing tool to see if their sites are prepared for mobile-first indexing. The tool is still in beta, so not all rich results and error types are supported yet. </p>\n<p>If your page supports rich results, you will see a confirmation and can click through to view the HTML. Certain rich result types will display a preview of how the result might appear in Google Search. If multiple result layouts are available, the tool will also let you drill down into the different layouts for both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-12.10.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you get a result that says &#8220;Page not eligible for rich results known by this test&#8221; when you know that you have the structured data in place, it could be because the beta version of this tool only supports a subset of rich result types.

The position was created and awarded to de Valk <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\">earlier this year</a>. Not only was it a new position, but it also expanded the leadership roles in the WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://joost.blog/marketing-wordpress-first-steps/\">making progress</a>, de Valk didn&#8217;t feel as though he was fulfilling the leadership aspect of his role. &#8220;My experience over the last few months made me feel that while I was doing things and getting things done, I certainly wasn’t leadership. I don’t want to pretend I have a say in things I don’t have a say in,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having a clear definition of what marketing means and having people within the project on the same page contributed to his decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s a stark difference between where I thought I would be in the organization in this role, and where I am actually finding myself now,&#8221; de Valk said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even things that every outsider would consider marketing (release posts,  about pages) are created without even so much as talking to me or others in the marketing team. Because I felt left out of all these decisions, I feel I can’t <em>be</em> a marketing lead.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also cited a lack of clarity surrounding his position, &#8220;I’ve been asked dozens of times on Twitter, Facebook and at WordCamps why I now work for Automattic, which of course I don’t but that is the perception for a lot of people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On other occasions, I seem to be the token non-Automattician, which I’m also uncomfortable with.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to taking a toll from failing to fulfill the position, de Valk plans to take an extended vacation during the Summer and when he returns, focus 100% of his efforts on Yoast and his Chief Product Officer role. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://joost.blog/why-im-stepping-down-from-my-wordpress-marketing-role/#comment-644\">commented</a> on de Valk&#8217;s article thanking him for being willing to try new things and for his passion, impatience, and drive to improve WordPress. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2019 17:57:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Take Back Your Web: Tantek Çelik’s Call to Action to Join the Independent Web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90416\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/take-back-your-web-tantek-celiks-call-to-action-to-join-the-independent-web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4246:\"<p><a href=\"https://tantek.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tantek Çelik</a>, Web Standards Lead at Mozilla and co-founder of IndieWebCamp, delivered an inspirational talk titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/336343886\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take Back Your Web</a>&#8221; at the most recent <a href=\"https://beyondtellerrand.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beyond tellerrand</a> conference in Düsseldorf, Germany. He opened the presentation with a litany of Facebook&#8217;s wrongdoings, taking the world&#8217;s largest social network to task for its role in increasing polarization, amplifying rage, and spreading conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>Çelik challenged the audience to &#8220;stop scrolling Facebook,&#8221; because its algorithms are designed to manipulate users&#8217; emotions and behaviors. He noted that it is the only social network with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Wikipedia page dedicated to its criticism</a>. This massive document has a dizzying number of references, which Wikipedia says &#8220;may be too long to read and navigate comfortably.&#8221; As an alternative to scrolling Facebook, Celik encouraged attendees to spend time doing nothing, an activity that can be uncomfortable yet productive.  </p>\n<p>The &#8220;Take Back Your Web&#8221; presentation is a call to action to join the independent web by owning your own domain, content, social connections, and reading experience. Celik recommends a number of IndieWeb services and tools to empower users to take control of their experiences on the web. </p>\n<p>With a free site hosted on GitHub, he said the costs of owning your own domain are less than owning a phone or having internet service. Suggestions like this are targeted at developers who share Twitter names instead of domains and post articles on Medium. Setting up a site on GitHub is not a simple task for most. That&#8217;s why networks like WordPress.com, along with hosts that provide instant WordPress sites, are so important for enabling average internet users to create their own websites.</p>\n<p>Celik referenced Matthias Ott&#8217;s recent article &#8220;<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Into the Personal-Website-Verse</a>,&#8221; highlighting the section about the value of learning new technologies by implementing them on your own website: &#8220;A personal website is also a powerful playground to tinker with new technologies and discover your powers.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the few places developers can expand their skills and make mistakes without the pressure to have everything working. Ott enumerates the many benefits of people having their own enduring home on the web and encourages developers to use their powers to make this a reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As idealistic as this vision of the Web might seem these days, it isn’t that far out of reach. Much of what’s needed, especially the publishing part, is already there. It’s also not as if our sites weren’t already connected in one way or another. Yet much of the discussions and establishment of connections, of that social glue that holds our community together – besides community events in real life, of course –, mostly happens on social media platforms at the moment. But: this is a choice. If we would make the conscious decision to find better ways to connect our personal sites and to enable more social interaction again, and if we would then persistently work on this idea, then we could, bit by bit, influence the development of Web technologies into this direction. What we would end up with is not only a bunch of personal websites but a whole interconnected personal-website-verse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out Çelik&#8217;s <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2019/05/indieweb/#cover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">slides</a> for the presentation and the recording below for a little bit of inspiration to re-evaluate your relationship with social networks, create your own site, or revive one that has been neglected.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2019 21:50:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 7.4 Adds Business Hours Block and Ability to Share Content Through WhatsApp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90503\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-4-adds-business-hours-block-and-ability-to-share-content-through-whatsapp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2229:\"<p>Jetpack 7.4 is <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/06/04/7-4-maintenance/\">now available</a> and includes a new Business Hours block.

If you would like to be a part of that number for future releases, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">the Core team blog</a> and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Successful WordPress Translation Day 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Translation Day is a 24-hour event organised by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">the Polyglots team</a> where community members from all over the world come together to translate WordPress into their local languages. For the fourth edition held on 11 May, 183 brand new contributors joined the Polyglots team from 77 communities across 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WP Translation Day is a great time for focussed contributions to localizing WordPress, but these contributions can happen at any time of the year, so if you would like to help make WordPress available in your local language, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots\">the Polyglots team blog</a> and join the #polyglots channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Plugin Guidelines Proposal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugins team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">has proposed some updates</a> to the guidelines for developers on the Plugin Directory. The majority of the proposed changes are intended to address significant issues faced by developers who do not speak English as a first language, making the Plugin DIrectory a more accessible and beneficial place for everyone.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal will be open for comments until late June, so the community is encouraged to get involved with commenting on them and the direction they will take the Plugin Directory. If you would like to be involved in this discussion, comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">the proposal</a> and join the #plugin review team in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continued Gutenberg Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the block editor was first released as part of WordPress Core in v5.0, development has continued in leaps and bounds with a new release every two weeks. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\">The latest update</a> includes some great incremental improvements that will be merged into the 5.2.2 release of WordPress along with the other recent enhancements.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the editor enhancements, work has been ongoing in the Gutenberg project to bring the block editing experience to the rest of the WordPress dashboard. This second phase of the project has been going well and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/31/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-20/\">the latest update</a> shows how much work has been done so far.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the Block Library project that aims to bring a searchable library of available blocks right into the editor is deep in the planning phase with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/28/block-library-initial-explorations/\">a recent update</a> showing what direction the team is taking things.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved in planning and development of Gutenberg and the block editor, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/\">Design</a> team blogs and join the #core, #design, and #core-editor channels in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The 5.2.2 release of WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/28/5-2-2-release-agenda/\">is currently in development</a> with a planned release date of 13 June.</li><li>Version 2.1.1 of the WordPress Coding Standards <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.1.1\">has been released</a> containing seven small, but relevant fixes.</li><li>The Theme Review Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\">have updated the details</a> of how the Trusted Authors Program works.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/29/who-wants-to-test-the-new-wordcamp-blocks/\">WordCamp-specific blocks have been launched for WordCamp sites</a> with organizers needing to sign up in order to test them out.</li><li>Continuing the growing trend of other platforms adopting the Gutenberg editor, it has now <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\">been ported to a plugin for OctoberCMS</a>.</li><li>Version 3.0 of the popular WordPress development environment, Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), <a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html\">was released this month</a>.</li><li>The Community Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/31/the-4-gets-in-wordpress-community-organizing/\">published some info</a> clarifying what organizers get (and don’t get) from being involved with their local communities. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

These animations can sometimes more clearly communicate changes, particularly in relationship to the action of moving or reordering items on a page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though the instant transformation of the interface is accurate it may not be the clearest expression of the change that just occurred,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The relationship between intention and effect might become harder to grasp. Motion can be a great aid in communicating relationships and clarifying the changes experienced in a more intuitive way.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This creates an interesting choice for an interface designer. Although instantaneous changes are possible to implement, they may require more time for the user&#8217;s brain to process. In the case of an editor, any added cognitive processing can pull a user out of the flow of writing. Ventura sets a good practical rule of thumb for determining if an animation adds value to an interaction:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One could say that an animation is worth being present if the clarity of change it provides is greater than the time it would take to adjust cognitively to the new state in its absence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ventura illustrates this concept with two video demos in his post &#8211; one showing how block reordering currently looks in WordPress&#8217; editor and a second with an example of how it could be improved with subtle, tasteful animations. It&#8217;s an early prototype but very convincing:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Gutenberg was still in the selling phase before being merged into core, some said that moving forward was simply a matter of retraining your muscle memory to work with the new editor. However, at that time there were still a number of markedly flawed interactions that didn&#8217;t feel natural and were even jarring for the user. The legacy editor didn&#8217;t have blocks to reorder or many of the other interactions introduced by the new block paradigm, so there wasn&#8217;t much prior context for comparison.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">User reviews</a> have complained about the cognitive load that Gutenberg adds and have continued to identify problematic interactions with the core blocks. Unfortunately, in many heated exchanges that took place in comments and discussions prior to WordPress 5.0&#8217;s release, these concerns were often brushed aside as coming from people who were resistant to change.</p>\n<p>Many of the reviewers may not have had the right words to communicate what it was they were experiencing, but the cognitive load may be one of the strongest reasons why the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin has more than 5 million active installs. </p>\n<p>Matías Ventura&#8217;s proposal to add motion to express change in the editor has the potential to solve some of these unintuitive interactions. The Gutenberg repository now has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15922\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> dedicated to exploring and discussing the use of motion to add clarity to the action of reordering blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/using-motion-to-express-change\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ventura&#8217;s post</a> is an encouraging read that demonstrates the thought and craftsmanship that go into architecting an interface that is required to meet the needs of millions of users. If you have been impatient with Gutenberg&#8217;s progress, as I have been, it&#8217;s important to recognize that these kinds of refinements to interactions take time to percolate. Replicating realistic motion comes from contemplating how we interact with the known world and understanding how that informs users&#8217; digital expectations. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2019 04:43:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"HeroPress: Ugyen’s Roadmap to WordPress Contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:156:\"https://heropress.com/essays/ugyens-roadmap-to-wordpress-contributions/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ugyens-roadmap-to-wordpress-contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44456:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/060419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The most valuable service is the one rendered to our fellow man.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#dzo\">འབྲི་རྩོམ་འདི་རྫོང་ཁ་ན་ལུ་ཡ་ཡོདཔ་ཨིན།</a></p>\n<p>Ugyen Dorji is from Bhutan, the landlocked country situated between two giant neighbors, India to the south and China to the north. Ugyen works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the robust Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans” and his work ethic shows with managing WordPress translation projects for his Plugin ’All-in-One WP Migration.’  Ugyen also keeps multi-language support for WordPress; furthermore the plugin is now translated into 42 languages with more on the way.</p>\n<h3>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</h3>\n<p>Life is a struggle &#8211; it is a mixture of success and failure which can come in any venture and that too late and sometimes most unexpectedly people lose heart after a failure; but a person who takes failure in his/her stride and continues his effort for success in long run in the word of EL Kerten means “The secret of success is knowing whom to blame for your failure.”</p>\n<p>Back in 2016, he had been looking for new working place after his former cloud company got shattered with some financial crisis, he has looked for a new job. For which he has tried his best and one fine day he makes it to an interview &#8211; where he has been triggered with WordPress questionnaires. On that moment he has no proper answer for interviewers saying big number to interviewers, though he has basic knowledge about WordPress. After that day, just sat in his room with silence and made up his mind to learn and get skilled himself with WordPress wisdom,  watching cities from his window receiving cool air, and said himself</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I will make my career with WordPress and it will be my bread and butter”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a few months, he received a call from ServMask Inc, who developed a great plugin called   &#8220;All-in-One WP Migration&#8221; which made his dream come true like an angle ServMask Inc blessed his dream to make his living with WordPress. Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>Ugyen’s First WordCamp Experience</h3>\n<p>WordCamp is a genuine spotlight for plugin and theme developers to reach WordPress users and website developers. It’s a glorious atmosphere where many incredible talks about WordPress take place. The “tribe” meetings are a phenomenal moment for aspiring computer engineers, content writers and developers to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was an essential day for Ugyen and ServMask because their sponsorship of the event delivered them the opportunity to connect with our active WordPress users and showcase their appreciation on better quality of WordPress plugin.</p>\n<h3>Contributor Day</h3>\n<p>The first day of WordCamp is Contributor Day. Ugyen associated with a community team and got to share a conversation with WordPress folks from all over the world. Community communication is the ground root of WordCamp and WordPress meetups, giving him all the chance to share and manifest what WordPress does and  how it is used. He also addressed encouraging more speakers and WordPress members to nurture their experience and whereby he could support new organizers to continue and contribute to building the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n<h3>Conference Day</h3>\n<p>Conference Day is the main event of WordCamp and is held on the second day. Ugyen was taking care of a Photo Booth for people to snap their memories. I think this was a great idea to capture the memories of WordCamp for attendees, speakers, and organizers.</p>\n<p>The foremost intention of the conference day is the presentations that take place throughout the day. Ugyen had a great moment to attend various talks which were very beneficial for developers, entrepreneurs, firms, and young startups firms. What holds in Ugyen&#8217;s mind is a plan that exhibits leveraging website content has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business extension.</p>\n<h3>How Ugyen became WordPress Meetup Thimphu Co-Organizer</h3>\n<p>Following October 2016, Ugyen came over about WordPress Meetup Bangkok and WordCamp Bangkok 2018. From that onwards, the importance of WordPress Meetup catches on his mind to introduce WordPress to his home country and cities. The foremost incidence that clicks on his mind was on WordPress Translation Day 3 on September 30, 2017, during WordPress Meetup Bangkok where he has seen his locale Dzongkha was in lowest percentage comparing to another locale status on WordPress Core Translation. Later in WordCamp Bangkok 2018 Contributors day when he met with WordPress Folks and WordPress Community, Meetup Organizer from many countries.</p>\n<p>WordPress Meetup Thimphu is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup covering everything related to WordPress and keeping our Bhutanese Gross National Happiness four pillars in mind with aims to preserve and promote our unique culture and national language. WordPress Meetup implies for individuals and all people who love WordPress and want to contribute and share their knowledge and have experience in meeting new faces and for networking. Ugyen’s Specific focus on encouraging local and international language WordPress bloggers and help startup companies to grow their assets with WordPress and share what he has learned from WordPress with his Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Ugyen’s First WordPress Meetup Thimphu was a huge success within his community coinciding with WordPress Main event WordPress Translation Day 4.  Ugyen would take a more vital role in preserving his national language by making use of WordPress actively by our Dzongkha bloggers, online Dzongkha news, government websites so that Bhutanese WordPress core contributors could hand over to our next generation very proudly.</p>\n<p>What we have achieved :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Done WordPress Core Translation for our locale Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>New Translation Contributor for our WordPress Core Translation for Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>Participated in <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org\">Global WordPress Translation Day 4</a> Livestream.</li>\n<li>Invited WordPress Experts from other countries to <a href=\"http://wpbhutan.slack.com\">http://wpbhutan.slack.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Invited WordPress Meetup Thimphu members to <a href=\"http://wpbhutan.slack.com\">http://wpbhutan.slack.com</a> to discuss more on WordPress related topics and for helpline on WordPress for Bhutanese WordPress users and wordpress.org login for new users.</li>\n<li>Speaker of the event Tenzin Namgyel Senior ICT officer from DDC WordPress Local Manager and General Translation Editor for our locale Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>Good meal and tea with great place to host at <a href=\"http://ariyabhutan.com/\">Ariya Hotel</a></li>\n<li>Introduction of a member for networking.</li>\n<li>Became a part of<a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/the-team/\"> Global WordPress Translation Day 4 team.</a></li>\n<li>Event Sponsored by ServMask Inc and Helped by Dzongkha Development Commission with Language Experts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>WordPress Future Road Plans</h3>\n<p>“The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today’s work superbly well” so that we can put all our effort, then we’ll see a very good result and success will surely be yours. No men can hope to have a very successful life but there will be one or two in exception in this earthly world in thousand cases of this matter which results strong determination can help to attain success. Therefore with Ugyen’s determination here are some of his road plans for WordPress.</p>\n<p>For WordPress Meetup: Ugyen’s next plan is to visit the language universities and teach them to blog in Dzongkha using WordPress. He said, “ We have plans to gather a group of active Bhutanese WordPress Bloggers and host panel talks to extend the beauty of Bhutan and unique culture of Bhutan to outside nations. And also one of the WordPress Main Events: Introduction to Open Source is in a process to be host soon. His Majesty the fourth King of Bhutan once said, “the future of our nation lies in the hands of our children.” Therefore Ugyen works to focus more on youth to enhance their WordPress Skills.</p>\n<p>For WordCamp: WordCamp Thimphu is my goal &#8211; to reach and invite more WordPress Experts as speakers of the main event and support Bhutanese to grow their career with WordPress. WordCamp Asia is in the process to kick start in 2020 and become one of the WordCamp Co-organizer among 41 WordCamp Asia Co-Organizers.</p>\n<p>To WordPress lovers &#8211; “If you want to be successful the ball is in your court, you think to throw a ball outside or smash the ball or play the game nicely and win the game’’</p>\n<h2 id=\"dzo\" class=\"p1\"><span

href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordproof-timestamp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof Timestamp</a> is a new free plugin that bridges the WordPress and blockchain communities in an approachable, user-friendly way. It gives users the ability to timestamp their posts and pages to demonstrate transparency and claim ownership of content.</p>\n<p>WordProof works with any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOS.IO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EOSIO</a> blockchain to create the timestamp and provides a custom certificate link with a frontend pop-up to display it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/timestamp-certificate.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin adds a &#8220;View the blockchain certificate&#8221; link under each post or page, which pops up the URL, title, content, timestamp information, and will soon also display revisions. Users will be able to browse through different timestamps to view the changes. </p>\n<p>WordProof Timestamp was first created by <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, a WordPress agency based in Amsterdam. This is the same company that recently open sourced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, a package that allows developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. Development has now been passed on to a dedicated WordProof team that is funded by Tenos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been working and investing with blockchain as a hobby since 2013,&#8221; Van Ons founder Sebastiaan van der Lans said. &#8220;After we built the <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-compliance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP GDPR Compliance</a> plugin and started working Laraberg, I am trying to work more and more on open source projects. From my point of view, WordPress + blockchain could not only democratize publishing but also doing business as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Lans said he expects that any type of publishing website or any site with &#8220;Terms &#038; Conditions&#8221; pages can benefit from timestamping. It&#8217;s especially useful in mediating claims of plagiarism and content theft. WordProof has no transaction costs and is almost instant (0.5s). Van der Lans said it was important for this solution to have no transaction fees, since it is fundamental to proving the author&#8217;s identity and the integrity of the content.</p>\n<p>Right now the plugin offers the ability to timestamp an entire article, including the title and content. Block level time-stamping is not on the roadmap, but the team is open to adding it in the future. They are currently looking into time-stamping media files and legal documents.</p>\n<p>After launching the plugin in beta, a team of 60 testers, from both the WordPress and EOS.IO blockchain communities, gave feedback that led to the creation of a WordProof Wizard to make it easier for users to set up the required accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our testers&#8217; main concern: it was too difficult to create an account on the blockchain and download and set-up a blockchain wallet afterwards,&#8221; Van Ons head of product Jelle van der Schoot said. &#8220;Therefore, we invested a lot of time into improving the UI/UX of the entire process (downloading the plugin, creating a blockchain account, downloading and setting up a wallet, timestamping).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The wizard supports both Telos and EOS and guides users through the process of setting up an account directly inside the WordPress dashboard. The process takes approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordproof-wizard.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe the WordProof Wizard can have a massive impact on the onboarding of new users to the blockchain in general, but more specifically to the Telos and EOS blockchains,&#8221; van der Schoot said.</p>\n<p>Timestamping posts is by no means a new idea. There are already several free WordPress plugins that have similar functionality and work with various blockchain technology, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Blockchain</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stampd-io-blockchain-stamping/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STAMPD.IO</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/po-et/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Po.et</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mingrana-wp-to-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mingrana WP to Blockchain</a>. WordProof is different from many of them in that it doesn&#8217;t use a centralized middle layer.</p>\n<p>The team behind the plugin is working on more tools that bring blockchain features to WordPress and will soon be adding cryptographically secured decentralized WordPress hosting to the <a href=\"https://wordproof.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof lineup</a>. van der Lans will also be speaking about more of the benefits of timestamping content with the blockchain at WordCamp Europe in his presentation titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/from-wordpress-to-blockchain-the-future-is-100-open-source/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">From WordPress to blockchain: the future is 100% open source</a>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the project, you can follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordProofio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof on Twitter</a> or join the <a href=\"https://t.me/WordProof\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof Telegram channel</a> where users can also find support for the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jun 2019 21:56:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: FreeCodeCamp Moves Off of Medium after being Pressured to Put Articles Behind Paywalls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90381\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/freecodecamp-moves-off-of-medium-after-being-pressured-to-put-articles-behind-paywalls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5824:\"<p>After four years of publishing on Medium, <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeCodeCamp</a> is migrating all of its articles to its own open source publishing platform, a modified version of <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ghost</a>. The platform allows approved authors to cross-post their blog articles on the new <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeCodeCamp News</a> site for free, without any ads.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium was a great place to publish because it helped a lot of people discover your articles. But the community has outgrown Medium,&#8221; FreeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium has shifted to a paywall model where they mainly recommend paywalled articles, then encourage visitors to pay to get around their paywall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the same time, not much of the traffic to Medium articles comes from Medium itself. Most of it comes from Google and social media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the detailed public <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/we-just-moved-off-of-medium-and-onto-freecodecamp-news-heres-how-you-can-use-it/279929\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on the FreeCodeCamp forums, Larson said he noticed his articles started to get less distribution after he decided that putting them behind a paywall would not be compatible with the mission of his organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As of 2019, Medium won’t give you much &#8216;distribution&#8217; within their platform unless you’re willing to put your articles to be behind their paywall,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;At the same time, if you do put your article behind their paywall, you’re limiting your readership to just the people who have the resources to pay. This is at odds with the goals of the freeCodeCamp community. We want to make these learning resources as widely available as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an email to blog authors who had published on FreeCodeCamp&#8217;s Medium publication, Larson elaborated on more serious concerns that he had with the platform&#8217;s approach to his organization. Oleg Isonen, one of the blog authors, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1134475953470656513/photo/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published the contents of the email</a>, which was later deleted at Larson&#8217;s request.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But over the past year Medium had become more aggressive toward us,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;They have pressured us to put our articles behind their paywalls. We refused. So they tried to buy us. (Which makes no sense. We&#8217;re a public charity.) We refused. Then they started threatening us with a lawyer.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-31-at-1.48.01-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many of those who read the email <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1134511135686877184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">encouraged Larson to write a follow-up article</a>, as Medium&#8217;s tactics towards publishers are a matter of legitimate public concern, both to those who use the platform and readers who support the company through subscriptions. </p>\n<p>Larson responded, confirming that he sent the email but that he wanted to move on from the situation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This email was intended only for Oleg and a few of our other authors. I have messaged him asking to delete it. We are focused on the future and want to move on from this.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Quincy Larson (@ossia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1134511135686877184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">freeCodeCamp News</a> site has migrated the organization&#8217;s 5,000 articles that were previously posted on Medium. The articles will still be available on Medium, but from now on freeCodeCamp plans to publish on its own platform. The site promises users full control, better analytics, AMP support, and a better reader experience that doesn&#8217;t require people to sign in or pay to read articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that all of us in the developer community can start our own blogs on the open web, then use community tools like freeCodeCamp News to raise awareness of them,&#8221; Larson said. </p>\n<p>Medium abruptly changed course in 2017 to become a publisher of subscription-based content, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scrapping the ad-driven revenue model</a> without notifying publishers ahead of time. Many publications that had invested heavily in building a following on Medium were forced to leave after discovering that the company did not have their best interests in mind. Medium&#8217;s new paywalled content model, which CEO Ev Williams claims is &#8220;a different, bolder approach&#8221; targeted at fixing what is broken with media, could not sustain publishers who were convinced to join the platform in its earlier days. </p>\n<p>FreeCodeCamp joins a wave of other publications that are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/publishers-are-moving-back-to-wordpress-after-short-experiments-with-medium\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">moving back to WordPress</a> and other open source platforms. This trend is set to continue as Medium&#8217;s obtrusive popups and poor reader experience drive readers away from the content hosted there. Publishers who are in it for the long haul, those who value stability and full control of their content, will return to the open web. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jun 2019 00:07:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 354 – Pantheon Acquires StagingPilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90371&preview=true&preview_id=90371\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-354-pantheon-acquires-stagingpilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2065:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss Panethon&#8217;s acquisition of StagingPilot and why regression visual testing will likely become a standard feature across managed WordPress hosts if it&#8217;s not already.

Starting a new page from scratch may be overwhelming for those who don&#8217;t have a vision for how to tastefully put blocks together to lay out the page. This is a problem that this experimental plugin may be able to solve.</p>\n<p>Full Site Editing currently provides three custom blocks for post content, templates, and a blog posts listing. The Blog Posts Listing block expands upon core&#8217;s Latest Posts block to include an excerpt and meta information.</p>\n<p>The plugin is available in the WordPress Plugin Directory, although it is somewhat difficult to find when searching in the admin plugin installer. The most recent 0.1.1 version of the plugin seems to be broken, but if you roll back to the initial release, you can see some of the page template experiments. After activating the plugin, navigate to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong> and a new modal with a template selector should pop up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-1.28.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The templates come pre-filled with demo content and images, so the user doesn&#8217;t have to think about how to configure the blocks to match the demo. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/full-site-editing-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The functionality in Full Site Editing is being developed for use on WordPress.com. It makes sense for a network that regularly onboards new bloggers and site owners. It is in the company&#8217;s best interest to deliver the fastest possible site creation experience, rather than have new users get frustrated and confused about how to get started. </p>\n<p>A template selector for creating new pages could also be useful for the broader WordPress community. Plugin developer Jeffrey Carandang tested Full Site Editing and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phpbits/status/1133677497789194240\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that it might be useful to add this functionality to Gutenberg with custom hooks so that developers can add their own custom templates. This would make guiding users through the new theme setup process much easier for theme shops.</p>\n<p>Automattic has a label on the Calypso repository dedicated to categorizing issues in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BGoal%5D%20Full%20Site%20Editing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full site editing</a> project. The plugin is going to be enabled on a small set of sites for <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/33163\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initial testing</a>. There are quite a few issues that still need to be ironed out, including things like preventing users from deleting the header and footer and finalizing the theme used with the plugin. At the moment, the plugin seems to be tailored specifically to the Twenty Nineteen theme and the pre-filled templates do not look as good when used with other themes.</p>\n<p>The functionality included in the Full Site Editing plugin may also be coming to Jetpack. Automattic&#8217;s developers are currently <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/32490\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">researching the best way to include it</a>, since so far it has been developed as a separate plugin and not geared towards becoming a Jetpack module.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-site-editing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Site Editing</a> is not recommended for use in production, as it&#8217;s still under active development. The plugin&#8217;s details explicitly state that it is &#8220;only designed to work on the WordPress.com environment and could break after an update.&#8221; Check it out if you want to explore some exciting new possibilities for how the block editor can work together with themes to make page creation more approachable for users. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2019 22:17:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: Pantheon Acquires Visual Regression Testing Platform StagingPilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/pantheon-acquires-visual-regression-testing-platform-stagingpilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2952:\"<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io\">Panethon</a>, a managed host geared towards Drupal and WordPress sites, <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/blog/robots-autopilot-and-holy-grail-webops\">has acquired</a> <a href=\"https://stagingpilot.com/\">StagingPilot</a>. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Nathan Tyler, founder of StagingPilot, and his brother Phil Tyler will be brought into the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot is a four year old company that runs a barrage of visual regression tests on WordPress sites before they&#8217;re automatically updated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot creates a copy of the site and places it into a staging environment. The service then conducts a number of tests that include, checking for visual errors, a white screen of death, and elements on a page disappearing. A number of snapshots are created along with a detailed report on the errors that are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josh Koenig, Co-Founder and Head of Product at Pantheon, says the acquisition puts the company within reach of the &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of WebOps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once you have a hundred sites (or heck, even twenty), the grind of keeping up with routine updates can be daunting,&#8221; Koenig said. &#8220;Our existing WebOps tools let our customers automate a lot of that maintenance, but building and managing that automation is on them. We want our users to automate their operations, not operate their automation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantheon plans to integrate StagingPilot into its offerings in three phases. First, it will migrate StagingPilot&#8217;s technology into its existing managed updates feature and extend it beyond WordPress to support Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the company plans to fully integrate the service with its organizational features providing substantial benefits to agency partners or those who manage many sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third phase looks to take advantage of services such as Google&#8217;s applied learning machines to create AI-driven testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out-of-the box, WordPress only updates minor versions automatically and leaves major updates, plugins, and themes up to the user. One of the most common fears of enabling auto-updates is having something on the site break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, the process of testing updates is left up to the consultant or whoever manages the site. Depending on the size or number of sites being managed, it can become a major time suck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting companies like Pantheon with StagingPilot, <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/products/managed-wordpress/\">LiquidWeb</a>, and others are easing the fear of auto updates in general and saving people a lot of time by using automatic visual regression testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about StagingPilot and to see Nathan demo the service in-person, check out this <a href=\"https://www.wpwatercooler.com/video/stagingpilot-w-nathan-tyler-wpshowandtell/\">episode of WPshowandtell</a> hosted by Jason Tucker. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2019 01:32:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 5.8 Released with Prototype of New Block-based Widgets Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-8-released-with-prototype-of-new-block-based-widgets-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3753:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 5.8</a> was released today with three new features and more than three dozen enhancements, documentation improvements, and bug fixes. </p>\n<p>This release gives users the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15625\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">change the text color in the Heading block</a>. The same color options available in the paragraph and button blocks are now available in the heading block.</p>\n<p>A recent release of the EditorsKit plugin (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-in-editorskit-1-5-justify-text-alignment-autosave-on-off-toggle-and-highlighted-text\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.5</a>) added this feature and the plugin&#8217;s author had tracked nearly two dozen issues and discussions where users have asked for text highlighting or similar features. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We really need this for all block controls (lists, paragraphs etc),&#8221; Ben Gillbanks <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15625#issuecomment-495940882\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the relevant GitHub issue. &#8220;Anything that can be used on a group block with a colored background could cause readability issues and so the text color will need to be changeable.&#8221; Gutenberg designer Mark Uraine said that adding text color options to all the text blocks is the next step following this update.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.8 adds <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14768\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support for reordering gallery images</a> using a simple arrow control to move selections forwards or backwards. This isn&#8217;t an ideal interaction but Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella said the team is exploring adding drag and drop support.</p>\n<p>Benguella shared a video that demonstrates these two new features:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This release introduces an initial version of the new widgets screen. You can check it out in the admin under the <strong>Gutenberg &raquo; Widgets (beta)</strong> menu. It&#8217;s currently just a proof of concept and has quite a few bugs but gives a preview of how the the widget management screen is shaping up. Benguella said users can currently edit/update widget areas using any available block. The proof of concept implementation in the plugin allows the team to continue polishing the UI and fix bugs in future releases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-4.11.47-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor is also making progress on mobile, adding quotes and video to the available blocks, rich captions for the image block, and fixes for several critical bugs. </p>\n<p>The editor has also recaptured some of its performance gains that were lost in version 5.7, according to recent performance benchmarks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-1.17.19-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had some commenters on previous posts who said they are confused about the difference between WordPress&#8217; core editor and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin</a>. The plugin is where active development gets committed. All the new features are put into the plugin first so they can be tested before being rolled into an official WordPress release later down the road.

These are sites Google defines as &#8220;previously unknown to Google Search.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Mobile searches are the primary way that users engage with the search engine for the past few years, which caused Google to begin prodding website owners to make their content more mobile friendly. Google&#8217;s indexing and ranking systems originally used the desktop version of a page&#8217;s content, but this can cause problems when desktop and mobile sites contain different versions of content. </p>\n<p>Mobile-indexing is not default for all websites yet, but Google started rolling it out more widely in 2018. Google evaluates older websites for readiness based on a variety of factors: </p>\n<blockquote><p>For existing websites we determine their readiness for mobile-first indexing based on parity of content (including text, images, videos, links), structured data, and other meta-data (for example, titles and descriptions, robots meta tags). We recommend double-checking these factors when a website is launched or significantly redesigned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there is no separate &#8220;mobile-first index.&#8221; Google still references a unified index for serving search results. The difference is in whether a page is crawled by a desktop or mobile user-agent.</p>\n<p>Prior to responsive web design becoming the industry standard, having a separate mobile site was a common practice. Google is actively discouraging this approach now (although still supporting it), as it often causes confusion for users and search engines alike.</p>\n<p>WordPress sites using a responsive theme shouldn&#8217;t have any issues with mobile indexing as long as they are not farming out their mobile sites to a separate domain. A responsive theme is usually enough to make a site compatible with this method of crawling.</p>\n<p>Website owners can check to see how their sites are being crawled by clicking on the &#8220;URL Inspection&#8221; tab inside the Google Search Console. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-28-at-9.37.57-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Webmasters of older sites will <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-floods-webmasters-with-mobile-first-indexing-enabled-notifications-305712\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">get a notification</a> from the Search Console when their sites are moved over to mobile-first indexing. </p>\n<p>After successfully ramping up mobile-first indexing from a small-scale experiment a few years ago, making it the default for new domains should be a good test for evaluating how aggressively it can be rolled out in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2839\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:170:\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10666:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052819-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t have made it through some of the hardest times in my life without WordPress.\" /><p>I grew up in the 90s and 2000s which was a weird time for technology. Part of me remembers carrying around a case of cassette tapes and the sound of dial-up occasionally screaming from the living room. The other half recalls hacking into my dad’s email from the shared family computer for the first time when I was ten. His passwords were never very hard to guess.</p>\n<p>In 2004 or 2005, I started taking more of an interest in the Internet. I wanted to start a blog maybe, but I wasn’t sure what a blog even was. WordPress was one of the first things I stumbled on, but it was still an infant compared to what it’s evolved into and I had no idea how it worked. Was WordPress a blogging website? Was it a thing I could build my own site with? How did it work?</p>\n<p>I just wanted somewhere to be myself online and WordPress intimidated me. So I dabbled, but I didn’t stay. Myspace and Tumblr would teach me to use HTML, because after all, I just wanted my own place to write online.</p>\n<h3>Finding My Way Back to WordPress</h3>\n<p>Eventually, my writing career led me back to WordPress. I was in college, studying English Literature when the opportunity for a Marketing Internship opened up. Around 2011, Chartwells Higher Education, a food service company for college campuses, had launched a huge multi-site network of university dining websites.</p>\n<p>Their largest initiative that year was to drive website traffic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mine was to keep the students from kicking us off campus because of how much everyone hated Campus Dining.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I started a blog.</p>\n<p>“The Inside Scoop” gave students the perspective of a student who works for campus dining. Both goals were met and I fell in love with the idea of using writing to address business problems. Even more exciting, I finally understood WordPress. Although by then, nearly ten years had passed and WordPress had completely changed.</p>\n<h3>Life Changed (a LOT), but WordPress Was Always There</h3>\n<p>At the same time throughout college, I went through a major transition from life as an extremely active athlete to someone with mobility problems. I broke my back, went through everything you can think of to fix it, and ended up with a permanent disability.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I knew by then how to work on a computer in an environment that didn’t necessarily require me to be in an office. It took a few years of adjustment, but eventually, I ended up working for a WordPress-based marketing agency remotely from an RV, which I took anywhere I felt like going.</p>\n<p>For a few years, I became a professional tourist.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’d wake up, get some work done, then adventure all day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By the time I was done, I could tour any city in a single day and still keep up with content writing. But writing content was all I did. Naturally, I still wanted my own website to write on, but all I had was Tumblr. How to actually set up a WordPress site from start to finish was a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>My partner at the agency was supposed to build the site for me, but it never happened. By the time my RV broke down in Rhode Island, 3,500 miles from my hometown, I had lost my chance to build a true travel blog and #vanlife became way too much of a fad to interest me anymore.</p>\n<h3>Learning to Build Websites with WordPress</h3>\n<p>My next step was to build my own website. I probably owe a lot of my “self-taught” skills to websites like WP Beginner and WPCrafter, but I really can’t remember how I learned other than trying and failing many times.</p>\n<p>After a few YouTube videos, I dove in and built the worst website that you could possibly imagine. It was atrocious, but I liked it enough, so I started writing on TaylorElizabethRose.com and building more websites.</p>\n<h3>Returning to a Burning California</h3>\n<p>My next few years were spent spinning my wheels on the East Coast and essentially failing at everything I tried. So I made a plan to move back to California and start my own WordPress-based business. By then I had learned a lot about website management, or so I thought.</p>\n<p>The first version of <a href=\"http://TaylordInk.com\">TaylordInk.com</a> was launched in May of 2017 before I made the trip back to California in September.</p>\n<p>As we drove into Napa Valley, I noticed how dry it looked and said,“This is a fire hazard.” There were no fire breaks and I had seen what the terrain looks like before it burns when my house burned in San Diego in 2007. Napa and Santa Rosa were primed for flames.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But, how many times in one person’s life can their house burn down?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was less than two weeks later when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire\">the Tubbs Fire</a> came through and burned my entire future. The man I’d been with for two years ended up abandoning me. My business equipment was gone. Any professional clothes I may have had were incinerated. All I had were my dogs and my 2013 MacBook Pro, which happened to be with me at the time.</p>\n<h3>Nothing but a Laptop</h3>\n<p>Between October and December 2017, I couldn’t tell you much about what I did or what happened except that I ended up back in my hometown: San Diego. It was a blur of loneliness, depression, and complete failure. Finally, sometime mid-December, I logged into my personal website.</p>\n<p>May as well start with my own identity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was hacked… and gone. I failed to update while I was swimming in my own sorrow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily, my friend from my agency days actually had a backup of the original site. So I salvaged the posts from his files and started rebuilding. I really didn’t get very far until much later in 2019. I just kept designing and redesigning the same pages over and over again.</p>\n<p>On the second or third time I logged in after the fire, I saw the WordCamp San Diego information on the Dashboard and bought a ticket before I could change my mind about going.</p>\n<h3>Discovering the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordCamp San Diego didn’t happen until months later, but it was the next time I really did anything productive in my life. It was kind of my last-ditch attempt to start a WordPress business or any business at all.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know who I would meet, or how (or if) I would fit in. I certainly never expected to find a community with open arms.</p>\n<p>A weight was lifted from my shoulders almost immediately. Where had all these nerds been my whole life? These were my people!</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a comfort that comes from fitting into a community and finding your people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Being in the company of like-minded people makes the future less bleak. I had hope again for the first time since the fire stole that from me.</p>\n<p>At some point during that WordCamp, a girl named Sochi found out that I was a content writer. She dragged me by the hand to meet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc?s=17\">Matt Cromwell</a> at the Give booth. It was extremely intimidating because the entire Give Team was sitting there staring at me. I didn’t know it then, but I was meeting my own future coworkers.</p>\n<p>Give was hiring a content writer! In fact, they were close to hiring someone else, but I was intrigued. So I inquired the next day and disrupted Matt’s hiring process a bit.</p>\n<p>The next week, I joined Team Give.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, I spoke at 4 WordCamps and attended 6 or 7 total.</p>\n<p>Working at Impress.org and participating in WordCamps has been incredible and I’ve learned more about WordPress over the past year than in all the years before. I don’t think I would have succeeded as well with my own WordPress-based marketing agency without the community.</p>\n<p>More importantly, I wouldn’t have made it through some of the hardest times in my life without WordPress. It was there when I needed to work remotely and it was there when I needed a helping hand to lift me back out of tragedy.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20Grew%20Up%20With%20WordPress%2C%20Then%20WordPress%20Saved%20Me&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F&title=I+Grew+Up+With+WordPress%2C+Then+WordPress+Saved+Me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052819-min-150x150.jpg&description=I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/\" title=\"I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/\">I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:00:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Taylor Rose\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WPTavern: Happy Sweet 16, WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wptavern.com/happy-sweet-16-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8623:\"<p>Over the weekend, the WordPress community celebrated 16 years since Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little forked the B2/cafelog blogging platform to create the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first official release of WordPress</a> on May 27, 2003.

Mullenweg shared his journey in a &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; style throughout the process of selecting the best route for templating and other decisions that laid the groundwork for the first release. Since those early days, WordPress has outpaced all its early competitors to become the most popular CMS by a wide margin. </p>\n<p>Sixteen years later, the software is available in more than 200 languages and is now used by <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33.9%</a> of the top ten million websites. WordPress&#8217; uncommon growth can be attributed to its unique combination of leadership, stability, and a community of thousands of contributors and entrepreneurs that are empowered by its open source licensing. </p>\n<p>Many WordPress product businesses, part of a commercial ecosystem that Mullenweg estimates at $10 billion/year, hosted sales, giveaways, and promotions in honor of the anniversary.

This plugin enables users to migrate specific content from one site to another without the need to update target URLs for media files. This version fixes a couple of UI related bugs and interactions with Gutenberg.</p>\n<h2>CannaBiz 2.4 Released</h2>\n<p>Robert DeVore <a href=\"https://www.wpdispensary.com/cannabiz-v2-4-release-notes/\">has released</a> CannaBiz 2.4, a WordPress theme that&#8217;s specifically tailored for the Cannabis industry.

Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t a good one.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When somebody comes to your project with a well-thought-out, unit-tested fix, and is met by radio silence? The chances are high that they will never come back again. I have submitted WordPress patches in the past, but after this experience I don’t know if I will bother submitting them again. That’s a big change in my perspective on how the WordPress team works, and on how it should work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jalkut isn&#8217;t the first nor will he be the last to have an experience like this. WordPress is a large project that encompasses many areas and if a particular ticket is not in line with higher priorities, the chances of it slipping through the cracks are pretty high.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Launches A New Product but Some People Have No Idea What It Is</h2>\n<p>Human Made has <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/2019/05/21/beyond-wordpress-10-year-evolution-human-made/\">launched a new product</a> called <a href=\"http://altis-dxp.com/\">Altis</a> which is a DXP or Digital Experience Platform for WordPress.

However, this also raises concerns about how sponsor expectations may influence a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can now sponsor developers as a seamless part of your familiar workflow,&#8221; GitHub open source project manager Devon Zuegel said in the announcement. &#8220;When a contributor answers your question, triages your issue, or merges your code, you can head to their profile—or simply hover over their username—to sponsor their work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/native-workflow-white.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Sponsorship is a somewhat subjective term and GitHub isn&#8217;t defining what it means here in the context of marrying it to a contributor&#8217;s workflow. For some, it may mean a no-strings-attached donation. For others, the idea of sponsorship always comes the expectation of a return on an investment. </p>\n<p>Ruby on Rails creator and Basecamp founder David Heinemeier Hansson was one of the most prominent to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1131585498395242496\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">raise concerns about GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors program on Twitter</a>. He sees it as &#8220;a grave risk to open source.&#8221; </p>\n<p>“&#8217;Why haven’t you fixed my issue yet!? I sent you $10! I demand you honor your obligations here. I paid you,&#8217; welcome to small-donation open source 2019,&#8221; Hansson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m sure GitHub had all the right intentions here. And I’m sure this will work out well for a select few developers who will amass enough donations to ignore individual claims to their time. But I think it’s a grave risk to the culture of open source.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hansson referenced a recent keynote he delivered at RailsConf 2019 titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open source beyond the market</a>,&#8221; challenging those whose initial reactions are simply that &#8220;donations are a good thing.&#8221; Bringing the concept of sponsorship a into the workflow introduces a transactional nature to the work, with unavoidable marketplace expectations that can complicate a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The marketplace norms are hard to escape,&#8221; Hansson said in his keynote. &#8220;They seep into our unconsciousness. There are plenty of open source users who think themselves less as a recipient of a gift and more like customers with warranty claims, that they’ve done the makers of said open source software a great honor by merely choosing to use their thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In fact, it’s kind of a natural extension of a society that worships consumerism above little less. A natural extension of &#8216;the customer is always right,&#8217; of the adversarial relationship between buyer and seller.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others have expressed more specific concerns, such as Microsoft&#8217;s GitHub becoming the dominant payment platform for open source developers, sponsors receiving priority consideration in issues and PRs over user and project needs, and developers deliberately introducing bugs in order to solicit donations. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Already seeing “I will prioritise your issues” in the ‘rewards’ sections on the first sponsor-enabled accounts&#8230; so.. you called it</p>\n<p>&mdash; Lasse Rafn (@LasseRafn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LasseRafn/status/1131601620582764555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pia Mancini, co-founder of Open Collective, <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-collective/on-github-sponsors-5450b63caf7d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a response</a> to the concerns that people were sending her way on Twitter. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy to see such an important player in the ecosystem helping out with the problem of sustaining open source,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;Sustaining our commons is an effort that requires everyone to contribute. I am glad to see Github come on board.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This idea of the sustainability of open source and the &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tragedy of the commons</a>&#8221; is one that <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hansson and many others reject</a>, but it is one that is commonly embraced by copyleft advocates. It works for Open Collective&#8217;s business model, but comes with its own flavor of reciprocity. Open Collective is distinct in that its funding service is removed from the direct workflow of software development, instead of deeply integrated like GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors tool. </p>\n<p>Mancini said that her company can &#8220;happily coexist with GitHub Sponsors&#8221; because of Open Collective&#8217;s chief differentiators. It was built for projects, not individuals. It offers full transparency about where funds come from and how they are spent. The company also manages the paperwork and tax forms required for fiscal sponsorship. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Open Collective is for funding projects as opposed to individual maintainers,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;We strongly believe in supporting communities as a whole, as well as the individuals that make up that community. This helps with ensuring more diversity, and less concentration of power and decisions on one maintainer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She also cautioned against GitHub trying to swallow up too many aspects of the open source community and injecting its own corporate interests. She hints at a line that the company has not yet crossed but many are still wary of what Microsoft plans to do with GitHub.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, there’s risk: centralization and lock-in are very risky for communities,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;GitHub is Microsoft, which has its own metrics in mind, and it will be difficult for them to be independent, regardless of the good faith of the folks involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Attempting to own all aspects of the open source community is a harmful strategy. So far, I don’t think GitHub is trying to do this. They are in a position to help, and they are open to collaborating with existing players.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Does it compete with Open Collective? To some extent. But our growth has never been primarily driven by individuals giving to individuals, but by companies giving to projects. GitHub Sponsors does not solve the need sponsor companies have for invoices and a legal entity to engage with for their vendor systems and documentation requirements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s intentions may simply be a recognition of what open source software has matured to become &#8211; a driving force of innovation in all industries and an effort worthy of financial support. Giving developers an easy way to receive some reward for their contributions seems rather innocuous, but the concern is that Microsoft cannot foresee the long term consequences of its sponsorship implementation inside GitHub&#8217;s workflow.

Automattic will begin working on a roadmap for the product after integrating the Prospress team into the company.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/prospress-joins-automattic-to-jointly-develop-woocommerce-subscriptions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement Q&#038;A</a>, Prospress founder Brent Shepherd said he is excited to see how Subscriptions will integrate with Automattic&#8217;s existing products and offered a glimpse at what they may be working on in the near future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In more specific terms, that could mean looking at closer relationships with how payments are handled, or integrations with other platforms such as WordPress.com. There are also a couple of things to solve both in WooCommerce and subscriptions to help them scale better. Interestingly, these challenges are almost identical for the two codebases. By working more closely to solve them than we ever could apart, I hope we can do a better job of implementing solutions and in a shorter time frame.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce Subscriptions can already be purchased a la carte and used on WordPress.com stores, so nothing will change in this department. I asked Paul Maiorana, head of partnerships for WooCommerce, if there are any plans to integrate Subscription functionality with Jetpack sites, as the plugin&#8217;s team is currently pursuing a Membership feature that is essentially recurring payments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re excited to learn from the Prospress team as they’re experts in this space, and could see Memberships potentially leveraging some of the Subscriptions code to avoid duplicating efforts — but we have no plans to integrate the products,&#8221; Maiorana said.</p>\n<p>The Prospress acquisition also includes <a href=\"https://automatewoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AutomateWoo</a>, a marketing automation tool, and <a href=\"https://robotninja.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Robot Ninja</a>, which offers automated checkout testing for WooCommerce stores. <a href=\"https://prospress.com/automatewoo-joins-prospress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prospress acquired AutomateWoo</a> in June 2018 as a complementary product to Subscriptions. There are no immediate changes planned for these products that would affect customers.</p>\n<p>Prospress has been deeply invested in the WooCoommerce open source project for many years. WooCommerce has 834 contributors and Shepherd is currently among the top 10. His company <a href=\"https://prospress.com/five-for-the-future-of-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">committed to the five for the future initiative</a> last year by sponsoring one of its employees to contribute full time to WooCommerce core. For the past five years Shepherd has also co-organized the WooCommerce San Francisco meet-up.</p>\n<p>Cornering the market on Subscriptions and being able to ensure a tight integration for customers gives WooCommerce a more competitive edge in the broader e-commerce space. Prospress&#8217; smaller products are also strategic additions to WooCommerce&#8217;s offerings. If Automattic can integrate the marketing automation and automated checkout testing tools in one hosted package, these tools have the potential to greatly increase customer&#8217;s success and confidence in their WooCommerce powered stores.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2019 23:20:27

You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for cataract surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

Normally, fluid in eye flows from behind pupil to a place between the iris and cornea, which is known as the angle of the eyes. This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age. In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually. Hence, relatives of patients diagnosed with OAG are advised to undergo regular eye check-ups, which enables the early detection of the condition and helps prevent its progression to blindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Closed-Angle Glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis condition is usually detected when a patient experiences pain and rapid vision loss.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advancements in contact lenses. Contact lenses enable people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions to enjoy normal vision. These conditions include:</p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>Infants and young children often suffer from various visual conditions, and contact lenses can help ensure that their vision system develops normally. At H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we offer various types of contact lens, which include:</p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic lenses (to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialised keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>As a major eye hospital, the contact lens services at PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attract participants nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Lenses for Children</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or do not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that is in closer proximity to the normal eye. This is important as it provides your child the best chance to develop good vision. Several parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. In addition, we educate parents about taking appropriate care of their child’s contact lenses to avoid potential problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the contact lenses are dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove them, as well as how to care for the lens when it is not in the child\'s eye. Patients wearing extended-wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Follow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, the vision is appropriate, and that no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Myopia (Near-sightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly. People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina. This often occurs if an eyeball is longer than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A history of myopia is among the major risk factors for myopia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are also highly associated with myopia.  Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor that is likely to cause myopia later in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Hyperopia (Farsightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A family history of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Astigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. It is the normal aging process of the lens, however, it can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Objects located nearby appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty in seeing objects located nearby</li></ul>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.</strong>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal whether you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Keratoconus?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n<p>Keratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause the distortion of visual images.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus. When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant is likely to be recommended.In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea. Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and is likely to slow the progression of keratoconus.

In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually. Hence, relatives of patients diagnosed with OAG are advised to undergo regular eye check-ups, which enables the early detection of the condition and helps prevent its progression to blindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Closed-Angle Glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis condition is usually detected when a patient experiences pain and rapid vision loss.

One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for cataract surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advancements in contact lenses. Contact lenses enable people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions to enjoy normal vision. These conditions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often suffer from various visual conditions, and contact lenses can help ensure that their vision system develops normally. At H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, we offer various types of contact lens, which include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic lenses (to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialised keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a major eye hospital, the contact lens services at PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attract participants nationwide.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lenses for Children</strong>\r\n\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or do not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that is in closer proximity to the normal eye. This is important as it provides your child the best chance to develop good vision. Several parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. In addition, we educate parents about taking appropriate care of their child’s contact lenses to avoid potential problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen the contact lenses are dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove them, as well as how to care for the lens when it is not in the child\'s eye. Patients wearing extended-wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</strong>\r\n\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, the vision is appropriate, and that no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Myopia (Near-sightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly. People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina. This often occurs if an eyeball is longer than average.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA history of myopia is among the major risk factors for myopia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are also highly associated with myopia.  Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor that is likely to cause myopia later in life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Hyperopia (Farsightedness)?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs when the eyeball is shorter than average.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA family history of hyperopia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction is likely to be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia, however, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so that the correct amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct certain forms of hyperopia.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What is Astigmatism?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n\r\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.\r\n\r\n<strong>Causes</strong>\r\n\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Is Presbyopia?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye. It is a refrective error that is caused most frequently by a disorder and not from a disease. This condition commonly occurs after the age of 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range.

It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risk Factors</strong>\r\n\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong>\r\n\r\nThe signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong>\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus.

A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, which results in a blurred image. Hyperopia is usually inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.<strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects that are located nearby</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia.

Astigmatism is among the eye conditions that are referred to as refractive errors, and these errors cause a disturbance in the way light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, as these conditions also result from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease, nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality is likely to result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto-refraction or subjective refraction, based on the patient’s response, which is performed at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument known as a keratometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is high enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses, and they have an additional power element known as a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis as compared to others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now.

This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause the distortion of visual images.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p><ul>\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cause of keratoconus are unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes are likely to be affected, one eye is usually more affected than the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus. Vigorous eye rubbing is believed to add to the development and progression of this disease, therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests and Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signs of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These are likely to include high degrees of astigmatism during the examination of the eye refraction or changes in the cornea during examination with the help of a slit lamp microscope. The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography and photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea to highlight irregularities that normally indicate the presence of keratoconus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatment and Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are no medicines available to help prevent the progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customisable oversized hard contact lens device, known as Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE), can also help improve the vision of several patients suffering from keratoconus. When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant is likely to be recommended.In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea. Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and is likely to slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>'),(2905,494,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2906,496,'home_image','167'),(2907,496,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2908,496,'page_content',''),(2909,496,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2910,497,'home_image','167'),(2911,497,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2912,497,'page_content',''),(2913,497,'_page_content','field_5cee199f0b963'),(2914,499,'home_image','162'),(2915,499,'_home_image','field_5cd00574bd707'),(2916,499,'page_content','<div class=\"common-wrapper clear-both\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Schwind Combi Wavefront Analyser<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\nH.V.

transmits light to the nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via the optic nerve for the perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Facilities available at H.V. Desai Hospital are:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Investigations</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination: Advanced high-resolution imaging technology for the consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity and conduct a detailed evaluation without the long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal for the use of such advanced technology</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography: To view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography: To view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non-perfused areas of the retina</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography: To view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography: For the detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography: To evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography: To graphically represent the functional capacity of the retinal cells</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential: For the measurement of the electrical activity of the visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Medical Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours and retinopathy of prematurity, among others, which are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by an indirect ophthalmoscope. Lasers available at the hospital include diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used for the treatment of tumours. They damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to the normal retina</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used for the treatment of conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease that causes ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Moreover, intravitreal steroids can be used for the effective treatment of macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used for the treatment of grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Vitreo-retinal surgery <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\"><p>Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly at H.V.

Normally, fluid in eye flows from behind pupil to a place between the iris and cornea, which is known as the angle of the eyes. This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age. In most cases, it affects both the eyes of a patient. In several cases, it goes undetected until it reaches a very advanced stage, as there are no prominent symptoms during its early stages. This type of glaucoma is usually. Hence, relatives of patients diagnosed with OAG are advised to undergo regular eye check-ups, which enables the early detection of the condition and helps prevent its progression to blindness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Closed-Angle Glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis condition is usually detected when a patient experiences pain and rapid vision loss. Fortunately, permanent damage is uncommon due to this condition as patients normally seek immediate medical help for these symptoms, which leads to prompt diagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs and symptoms of closed-angle glaucoma <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Eye pain, usually severe</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Eye pain is often accompanied by nausea and sometimes vomiting</li>\r\n 	<li>Lights appear to have extra halo-like glows around them</li>\r\n 	<li>Red eyes</li>\r\n 	<li>Sudden and unexpected loss of vision, especially in dim light</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOther types of glaucoma: traumatic glaucoma, congenital glaucoma, drug-induced glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, etc.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion\">\r\n<div class=\"accordion-title\">Who are at the High Risk of Suffering from Glaucoma? <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\nMost often, glaucoma occurs in adults aged over 40 years, however, it can also occur in young adults, children, and infants.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','publish','closed','closed','','retina','','','2019-06-25 14:01:23','2019-06-25 14:01:23','',0,'http://local.hvd.com/?post_type=facilities&#038;p=74',0,'facilities','',0),(75,1,'2019-05-03 08:08:11','2019-05-03 08:08:11','','Retina','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','A speciality clinic of H.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

Now the world’s largest eye care complex, Aravind served 4.7 million outpatients and performed more than 463,000 surgeries and laser procedures in the 2016-17 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nOn Litwin’s first trip to India, Venkataswamy took him to an eye camp in Pondicherry. One thousand people received cataract surgery over the course of a week.\r\n\r\n“I was converted,” Litwin reminisced. “I realized something magical was going on. If one patient is static like a bird on a branch, an eye camp is different; more like a flock of birds sweeping across the sky.”\r\n\r\nOn that inaugural trip, Litwin introduced Aravind to the newly-developed technology of intra-ocular lenses. IOLs revolutionized cataract surgery. With Seva’s support, the Aravind system established in-country IOL manufacturing, bringing the cost down to the point where cataract surgery is so affordable that no one is turned away for lack of funds.\r\n\r\n“The Aravind eye care system is fulfilling Dr. V’s vision of solving blindness,” said Litwin. “There has been someone on Seva’s Board of Directors from the Aravind system from the beginning. They help us, they teach us, and we work collaboratively on projects.”\r\n\r\nOn his most recent trip, Litwin visited Pune for the first time, to meet with the top brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital. HV Desai is involved in a Seva initiative to establish Vision Centers, “small optical shops in remote areas where there are no eye hospitals and tremendous numbers of blind people,” explained Litwin. Trained staff at these centers can prescribe glasses, treat diseases with antibiotics and take cell-phone photos of more complex problems to send to an eye hospital for diagnosis. The centers arrange transportation to the hospital for patients needing surgery. “We hope to reach a billion people through this approach,” Litwin said.\r\n\r\nDr. Colonel M. Deshpande at HV Desai, who worked with Venkataswamy, shared with Litwin that vision centers suffered from high staff turnover due to their remote locations. In response, a new system was devised where the centers started operating once a week on Market Day, at a central location like a religious institution.\r\n\r\nPeople now know that they attend to their eye care needs on Market Day. Litwin will share this and other creative solutions with staff at Seva, who work with eye care providers in more than 20 countries.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\nSeva is able to use insights like these from Litwin’s trips to India to inform their work in other countries facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins have formed several lifelong friendships with Indian colleagues over the years. On this most recent trip, they visited Dr. Asim Sil and his wife, Dr. Subhra Sil, at Vivekananda Mission Ashram Netra Niramay Niketan eye hospital, near Kolkata.\r\n\r\nThey’ve known Asim and Suhbra for 12 years, and Litwin has worked with them on earlier projects, like establishing a corneal transplant program. They now vacation regularly together, including a recent river trip in the Sundarbans, an area that sends patients to one of the two eye hospitals Seva supports in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Aravind Eye Care System sets the gold standard for eye care in India. The system’s latest branch hospital, which just opened in Chennai a few months ago, has the capacity to treat 6,000 patients daily. This new hospital is being run by Dr. S. Aravind – who was 12 years old when Dick and Judith first met him – and his wife, Dr. Haripriya, a dynamic cataract surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins’ many volunteer visits and personal relationships have grown Seva’s partnership network in India to include 60 partner eye care institutions based in 17 Indian states. Seva and its partners in other countries continue to benefit from best practices developed in India to make eye care accessible and affordable worldwide.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_bottom_content\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\n</div>','Eye Doc Makes Annual India Trip, Strengthens Partnership to Prevent, Reverse Blindness','On his most recent trip, Litwin visited\r\nPune for the first time, to meet with the\r\ntop brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital.','publish','closed','closed','','eye-doc-makes-annual-india-trip-strengthens-partnership-to-prevent-reverse-blindness','','','2019-06-25 10:55:57','2019-06-25 10:55:57','',0,'http://local.hvd.com/?post_type=news&#038;p=111',0,'news','',0),(112,1,'2019-05-05 19:42:02','2019-05-05 19:42:02','','Eye Doc Makes Annual India Trip, Strengthens Partnership to Prevent, Reverse Blindness','On his most recent trip, Litwin visited\r\nPune for the first time, to meet with the\r\ntop brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital.','inherit','closed','closed','','111-revision-v1','','','2019-05-05 19:42:02','2019-05-05 19:42:02','',111,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/05/05/111-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(115,1,'2019-05-06 07:30:28','2019-05-06 07:30:28','<div class=\"breadcrumbs mb-4 clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Our Facilities / Specialities /<strong> Cornea</strong></div>\r\nThe cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil and anterior chamber.

Some examples include contacts following injury or corneal transplantation, contacts with artificial iris, and contacts for eye conditions such as keratoconus and Aphakia.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Service</h2>\r\nThe Contact Lens Service evaluates and fits patients of all ages using the latest in contact lens technology and information, often before it has even been introduced in the general eye practitioner\'s office. The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advances in contact lenses. Contact lenses allow normal vision for people with a wide range of medical conditions. This includes patient who have:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often have various visual conditions that require a contact lens so that their vision system can develop normally.

V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\n\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\n\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\n\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\n\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. The state-of-the-art facilities available at PBMA’s H.V Desai Eye Hospital include High end Biometry &amp; Operative Planning modules; Phacoemulsification systems &amp; Operating Microscopes which enable us to perform Phacoemulsification (Micro incision suture less surgery) and Small Incision Cataract surgery.\r\n<h2>Facilities for cataract surgery</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag Streit Lenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n 	<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions.

For those who are found to be unfit for LASIK, we provide PRK.\r\nThe availability of the latest technologically advanced diagnostic equipment and laser technology has enabled us to provide better, safer and predictable outcomes. Wavefront-guided LASIK is among the most preferred methods for vision correction worldwide. With its excellent safety profile, patient comfort and superior visual outcomes, wavefront-guided laser platforms provide the best image quality with a clearer vision. The entire vision correction procedure takes less than 15 minutes, and patients are able to resume their day-to-day activities the very next day.\r\n\r\nH.V.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underwe','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-10 11:30:28','2019-06-10 11:30:28','',74,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/06/10/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(421,1,'2019-06-10 11:40:09','2019-06-10 11:40:09','<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception in the year 2000, PBMA’s&nbsp;H.V.

Desai Eye Hospital specialises in dealing with all types of glaucoma, including primary, secondary, paediatric and end-stage glaucoma. At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

V. Desai Eye Hospital evaluate and fit contact lenses that correct for near-sightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. Our optometrists also can recommend new options in soft and rigid lenses for presbyopia. Contact lenses also have therapeutic uses, and contacts for a medical diagnosis are prescribed as well. Some examples include contacts following injury or corneal transplantation, contacts with artificial iris, and contacts for eye conditions such as keratoconus and Aphakia.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Service</h2>\r\nThe Contact Lens Service evaluates and fits patients of all ages using the latest in contact lens technology and information, often before it has even been introduced in the general eye practitioner\'s office. The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advances in contact lenses. Contact lenses allow normal vision for people with a wide range of medical conditions. This includes patient who have:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often have various visual conditions that require a contact lens so that their vision system can develop normally. We offer every type of contact lens, including:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic Lenses ( to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialized keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a major eye hospital, PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state.

The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge.

Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz.

Now the world’s largest eye care complex, Aravind served 4.7 million outpatients and performed more than 463,000 surgeries and laser procedures in the 2016-17 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nOn Litwin’s first trip to India, Venkataswamy took him to an eye camp in Pondicherry. One thousand people received cataract surgery over the course of a week.\r\n\r\n“I was converted,” Litwin reminisced. “I realized something magical was going on. If one patient is static like a bird on a branch, an eye camp is different; more like a flock of birds sweeping across the sky.”\r\n\r\nOn that inaugural trip, Litwin introduced Aravind to the newly-developed technology of intra-ocular lenses. IOLs revolutionized cataract surgery. With Seva’s support, the Aravind system established in-country IOL manufacturing, bringing the cost down to the point where cataract surgery is so affordable that no one is turned away for lack of funds.\r\n\r\n“The Aravind eye care system is fulfilling Dr. V’s vision of solving blindness,” said Litwin. “There has been someone on Seva’s Board of Directors from the Aravind system from the beginning. They help us, they teach us, and we work collaboratively on projects.”\r\n\r\nOn his most recent trip, Litwin visited Pune for the first time, to meet with the top brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital. HV Desai is involved in a Seva initiative to establish Vision Centers, “small optical shops in remote areas where there are no eye hospitals and tremendous numbers of blind people,” explained Litwin. Trained staff at these centers can prescribe glasses, treat diseases with antibiotics and take cell-phone photos of more complex problems to send to an eye hospital for diagnosis. The centers arrange transportation to the hospital for patients needing surgery. “We hope to reach a billion people through this approach,” Litwin said.\r\n\r\nDr. Colonel M. Deshpande at HV Desai, who worked with Venkataswamy, shared with Litwin that vision centers suffered from high staff turnover due to their remote locations. In response, a new system was devised where the centers started operating once a week on Market Day, at a central location like a religious institution.\r\n\r\nPeople now know that they attend to their eye care needs on Market Day. Litwin will share this and other creative solutions with staff at Seva, who work with eye care providers in more than 20 countries.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\nSeva is able to use insights like these from Litwin’s trips to India to inform their work in other countries facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins have formed several lifelong friendships with Indian colleagues over the years. On this most recent trip, they visited Dr. Asim Sil and his wife, Dr. Subhra Sil, at Vivekananda Mission Ashram Netra Niramay Niketan eye hospital, near Kolkata.\r\n\r\nThey’ve known Asim and Suhbra for 12 years, and Litwin has worked with them on earlier projects, like establishing a corneal transplant program. They now vacation regularly together, including a recent river trip in the Sundarbans, an area that sends patients to one of the two eye hospitals Seva supports in the region.\r\n\r\nThe Aravind Eye Care System sets the gold standard for eye care in India. The system’s latest branch hospital, which just opened in Chennai a few months ago, has the capacity to treat 6,000 patients daily. This new hospital is being run by Dr. S. Aravind – who was 12 years old when Dick and Judith first met him – and his wife, Dr. Haripriya, a dynamic cataract surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe Litwins’ many volunteer visits and personal relationships have grown Seva’s partnership network in India to include 60 partner eye care institutions based in 17 Indian states. Seva and its partners in other countries continue to benefit from best practices developed in India to make eye care accessible and affordable worldwide.\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_bottom_content\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"></div>\r\n</div>','Eye Doc Makes Annual India Trip, Strengthens Partnership to Prevent, Reverse Blindness','On his most recent trip, Litwin visited\r\nPune for the first time, to meet with the\r\ntop brass at HV Desai Eye Hospital.','inherit','closed','closed','','111-revision-v1','','','2019-06-25 10:55:57','2019-06-25 10:55:57','',111,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/06/25/111-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(524,1,'2019-06-25 10:58:33','2019-06-25 10:58:33','<p class=\"m-story-header__intro\"><strong>The Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages.</strong></p>\r\nThe Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages. One week in May, starting from the second Sunday of the month — May 13 to May 19 this year — is observed as World Retinoblastoma Week, to raise awareness about retinoblastoma (RB), which is a life-threatening eye cancer affecting newborn and very young children up to 5 years of age.\r\n\r\nIt can occur either in one eye or both. According to Iksha Foundation, reported incidences of RB are increasing. Doctors suggest systemising eye screenings for toddlers will go a long way in preventing childhood blindness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Sonal S Chaugule, consultant, ophthalmic plastic surgery, orbit and ocular oncology, H V Desai Eye Hospital, Pune, “Awareness about retinoblastoma is low and early detection is crucial to give the best chance of saving the child’s life, eye and vision. Early detection and proper treatment will ensure 95 per cent of the children diagnosed with RB are saved from death, 90 per cent have their eye intact and 85 per cent have their vision protected.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, in India, a child is taken to an eye specialist only when there is any notable problem, which makes treatment of RB at a later stage much harder,” she said. Against this background, she suggests that systemised screening of eye for any abnormality in infants/toddlers should be made mandatory and sensitising doctors and healthcare authorities at different levels assumes great importance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thanmaya Bekkalale, founder and trustee, Iksha Foundation, “We only know the reported cases of RB, there are numerous cases that go unreported. The need of the hour is to spread individual and societal awareness about RB and promote early detection as it is documented that every day, four children are born with eye cancer in India, and one of them is facing death as a result of diagnosis at advanced stage or not diagnosed at all.”','Awareness programmes about retinoblastoma','','publish','open','closed','','awareness-programmes-about-retinoblastoma','','','2019-06-25 10:59:34','2019-06-25 10:59:34','',0,'http://local.hvd.com/?post_type=news&#038;p=524',0,'news','',0),(525,1,'2019-06-25 10:58:33','2019-06-25 10:58:33','<h2 class=\"m-story-header__intro\">The Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages.</h2>\r\nThe Iksha Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO supporting children with eye cancer, has stepped up programmes to spread awareness about retinoblastoma and ensure that the disease is detected in potential victims in its early stages.

underweight babies due to lack of development of the retina. It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-25 14:01:23','2019-06-25 14:01:23','',74,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/06/25/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(582,1,'2019-06-25 14:02:03','2019-06-25 14:02:03','<div class=\"breadcrumbs mb-4 clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Our Facilities / Specialities /<strong> Glaucoma</strong></div>\r\n\r\nV.

We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','A speciality clinic of H.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.
