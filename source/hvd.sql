You can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">the field guide for this release</a> for more detailed information about what was included and how it all works.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>327 individual volunteers contributed to the release. If you would like to be a part of that number for future releases, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">the Core team blog</a> and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Successful WordPress Translation Day 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Translation Day is a 24-hour event organised by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">the Polyglots team</a> where community members from all over the world come together to translate WordPress into their local languages. For the fourth edition held on 11 May, 183 brand new contributors joined the Polyglots team from 77 communities across 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WP Translation Day is a great time for focussed contributions to localizing WordPress, but these contributions can happen at any time of the year, so if you would like to help make WordPress available in your local language, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots\">the Polyglots team blog</a> and join the #polyglots channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Plugin Guidelines Proposal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugins team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">has proposed some updates</a> to the guidelines for developers on the Plugin Directory. The majority of the proposed changes are intended to address significant issues faced by developers who do not speak English as a first language, making the Plugin DIrectory a more accessible and beneficial place for everyone.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal will be open for comments until late June, so the community is encouraged to get involved with commenting on them and the direction they will take the Plugin Directory. If you would like to be involved in this discussion, comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">the proposal</a> and join the #plugin review team in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continued Gutenberg Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the block editor was first released as part of WordPress Core in v5.0, development has continued in leaps and bounds with a new release every two weeks. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\">The latest update</a> includes some great incremental improvements that will be merged into the 5.2.2 release of WordPress along with the other recent enhancements.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the editor enhancements, work has been ongoing in the Gutenberg project to bring the block editing experience to the rest of the WordPress dashboard. This second phase of the project has been going well and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/31/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-20/\">the latest update</a> shows how much work has been done so far.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the Block Library project that aims to bring a searchable library of available blocks right into the editor is deep in the planning phase with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/28/block-library-initial-explorations/\">a recent update</a> showing what direction the team is taking things.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved in planning and development of Gutenberg and the block editor, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/\">Design</a> team blogs and join the #core, #design, and #core-editor channels in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The 5.2.2 release of WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/28/5-2-2-release-agenda/\">is currently in development</a> with a planned release date of 13 June.</li><li>Version 2.1.1 of the WordPress Coding Standards <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.1.1\">has been released</a> containing seven small, but relevant fixes.</li><li>The Theme Review Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\">have updated the details</a> of how the Trusted Authors Program works.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/29/who-wants-to-test-the-new-wordcamp-blocks/\">WordCamp-specific blocks have been launched for WordCamp sites</a> with organizers needing to sign up in order to test them out.</li><li>Continuing the growing trend of other platforms adopting the Gutenberg editor, it has now <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\">been ported to a plugin for OctoberCMS</a>.</li><li>Version 3.0 of the popular WordPress development environment, Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), <a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html\">was released this month</a>.</li><li>The Community Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/31/the-4-gets-in-wordpress-community-organizing/\">published some info</a> clarifying what organizers get (and don’t get) from being involved with their local communities. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Whether you are a developer helping clients or you manage your site solo, these tools can help get you the right information when you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Health Check and PHP Error Protection tools have brand new features, giving you peace of mind if you discover any issues with plugins or themes on your site. There are also updates to the icons available in your dashboard, fresh accessibility considerations for anyone using assistive technologies and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and Theme Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 5.2 and update the <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 5.2. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so we can figure those out before the final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.2 Field Guide</a> has also been published, which goes into the details of the major changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 5.2 release schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a>&nbsp;in the support forums.

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 09:29:34 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml;

The concept was inspired by Material design and is traditionally used for providing brief messages about app processes at the bottom of the screen. Gutenberg&#8217;s new Snackbars pop up and disappear after a short delay, so the notice doesn&#8217;t have to be dismissed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For a distraction-free experience, all the notices used in the editor to inform about the post saving/publishing, reusable blocks creation and updates have been updated to use this new type of notice,&#8221; Gutenberg Phase 2 lead Riad Benguella said. He posted a gif demonstrating Snackbar notices in action:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/snackbars.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release brings several visual enhancements to blocks and UI components, including a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15903\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">redesign of the Table block placeholder</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14843\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refactoring and consolidation of dropdown menus</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15874\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">improvements the output of the Spacer block</a>.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.9 contains more than two dozen fixes for bugs found in both desktop and mobile experiences. The editor took a slight dip in performance from the previous version, going from 4.8 to 4.9 seconds in loading time and 62.8ms to 66.3ms for keypress events.

Especially when it first came to video and they could watch it every day… or two or three times a day if mom wasn’t feeling good or catching up on sleep from being up with baby brother the night before.</p>\n<p>There’s this strange part of that movie where Moana follows Maui to a place under the ocean called “The Realm of Monsters.” It’s where monsters go after being killed. If you have younger kids, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. If you don’t have kids, it’s when the giant crab sings the song “Shiny.”</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>One common theme in myths, legends, and ancient religious writings, is where the hero visits the underworld, aka “afterlife” or “hell.” There they experience a symbolic or actual death for themselves or a loved one. Often through conquering a monster who is the Lord of the Underworld, they then re-emerge with their loved one, new knowledge and power, and/or some object to help them on their quest.</p>\n<p>The film Moana clearly plays out this theme. She and Maui emerge triumphant from the realm of monsters, having defeated the giant crab by flipping it on its back and retrieving Maui’s magical hook.</p>\n<p>In Return of the Jedi, Luke descends to the underworld of Jabba&#8217;s Palace. There, he’s able to bring his friend Han Solo back from a virtual death, defeat the Rancor, kill Jabba the Hut (lord of the criminal underworld), save the princess, and retrieve his lightsaber. All this happens before we see even one single, fuzzy, cute, unblinking Ewok…. Unless you believe in the “special editions,” in which case the Ewoks blink.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>There are many movies, books, stories, mythologies, etc that all follow similar patterns.</p>\n<p>Like Maui’s hook or Luke’s lightsaber, in these stories the hero often emerges from the underworld with newfound knowledge and/or a powerful object. Briefly, I’d like to take you on my own personal “Hero’s Journey” to the dark underworld of WordPress hosting. Along with it my quest of building a business on WordPress and hosting, with its own mythical monsters to slay, trials to be conquered, riddles to be solved, and ultimately new knowledge and weapons gained.</p>\n<h3>The Call to Adventure</h3>\n<p>In the early days of my business, Fiddler Online (<a href=\"https://wordx.press/what-the-change-to-wordxpress-means-for-our-members/\">now called WordXpress</a>), I envisioned building websites for companies on WordPress, then charging a monthly fee to maintain, support, edit, update, and manage them. I got started with a few clients and wanted to grow.</p>\n<p>I’d trusted someone to set me up with a very inexpensive VPS on unmanaged hosting. He was supposed to do the managing and ensure it all ran smoothly. I quickly learned you get what you pay for! Soon our members’ sites started going offline, usually all at once as the VPS crashed from one problem or another. It wasn’t just the server being down that caused problems. It was also corrupting data and other strange and scary things that I’d never encountered before, such as the body content of posts and pages being cut off, starting with the first special character that appeared in the content (a database issue).</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>These were dark and scary monsters to battle. I knew cPanel pretty well, but the APACHE stack that ran beneath it was mostly a mystery to me. So was database encoding and other advanced technical realms that all have an impact on the server, WordPress, and ultimately our clients’ businesses.</p>\n<p>The monsters appeared, seemingly determined to kill my small and struggling business, shortly after the birth of our first child. I was frequently up all night working with “Todd” the server guy (we’ll call him) to try and get the websites back online. We’d vanquish one monster, rest a day or so, and find another had taken some sites down again.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of constant frustration, I said “enough” and signed up for a Hostgator reseller plan. This was back when they were an independent hosting company. On this new plan I could install as many cPanel’s as I needed and manage each separately! I thought it was wonderful and would solve all my problems. Hostgator transferred all our sites from the terrible VPS hosting we’d been on to their servers and I thought perhaps that was it!</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought my quest was over. I’d fought the monsters and won.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scary as it was, it had been relatively brief. I’d learned a lot, but felt like I’d been to the underworld and back!</p>\n<h3>The Illusion of Safety</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the wraiths had cast a spell over me, blinding me to the fact that they were still lurking in the shadows. When transferring our WordPress websites to our new account, Hostgator had copied each entire cPanel over from the VPS. This eliminated the underlying problems in the APACHE stack on that horrible VPS, but brought with it the fiends that had infiltrated cPanel and even our WordPress websites. To be clear: they weren’t infected with any kind of malware, but configuration problems, cruft, and who knows what else, caused some really bad results.</p>\n<p>With my new spellbound, but misled confidence, I pushed our business forward. I brought on a business partner, Kurt as the sales guy. Later we acquired another website company. Through all that, we’d learned a lot, and doing okay for that stage, but still struggled financially as we bootstrapped this new business from nothing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we acquired this other business, they’d been running all their client’s sites on WordPress Multisite. It seemed like a great idea because of how it allowed us to manage all the websites in one place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the progress the business made, the monstrosities emerged again and this time with higher stakes since our business had grown and was now managing many more websites. These monsters emerged partly from what had been transferred over with cPanel, and the difficulties of running a large Multisite where each child site had its own theme, plus the weight of adding more and more websites and traffic to hosting that was really just shared hosting with WHM access and more control.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>The Plunge Into the Underworld</h3>\n<p>In each hero’s journey, there’s often a wizard or goddess that helps guide and mentor the hero along his journey. I eventually made friends with a great guy we’ll call Sam. He ran his own hosting company with data centers and a great support staff. Sam was somewhat like Obi-Wan, Merlin, or Maui in these stories: he was my mentor and companion on my adventures into the underworld that followed. He made a great guide, because he’d been there before. Unfortunately, his own journey had never taken him to some of the deepest darkest places we would soon encounter.</p>\n<p>So we moved to Sam’s hosting, where he kindly watched things closely and provided a server admin’s perspective and advice at a much lower price than he would have normally charged.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long before the demons, wraiths, monsters, and other ghouls started crawling from the darkness. It started with random downtime. Then followed strange limitations on websites. Next emails were not getting delivered. Then it was slowness. Now we were hacked… or were we? Suddenly all the contents of all pages and posts were cut off (we thought we killed this monster before)! Then email wasn’t being sent. Next our server is sending spam email. Now a hard drive is dying. It just kept going and going. Many of these demons were completely new to Sam and his very experienced team.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before there were whisperings of “the Fiddler curse.” This curse referred to Fiddler Online the name of our company. The hosting support team joked that we were cursed. All kinds of issues arose that they’d never seen before, and with a frequency they’d never experienced either.</p>\n<p>When a car crashed into the data center’s power regulation center during a freak storm, it cut off power from the normal power lines, as well as from their automatic backup power supply! It completely took the data center offline. The “Fiddler curse” was in full force.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Or put better, we were in the deepest, darkest, part of the underworld, locked in an all-out battle with the worst demons and wraiths it had to send against us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We tried method after method to defeat the monsters. We tried rebuilding the server stacks. We tried various WordPress optimizations. We bought our own server and had it installed in their data center. We even tried a totally different Linux stack and something called Interworx, a cPanel alternative, that came with load balancing and real-time backup. But no matter how much money, time, and knowledge we threw at it, the issues continued. No matter how many monsters we slew, we were still losing the war.</p>\n<h3>The “Real World” Dragons</h3>\n<p>When I recently asked my wife Jill about that time of our lives, she said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From my perspective, it was hard to know when to throw in the towel and say ‘enough’ because it’s just not working. Getting the hosting sorted out totally changed the entire dynamic and perspective of doing our own business. Before that, it felt like we were building a dream on a crumbling foundation.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>And don’t get the wrong idea from this image. Jill was no damsel in distress. She’s a warrior too. I’d have never completed this quest without her there, fighting alongside me. She may have not fought the technical fiends, but there were plenty other monsters in the form of financial struggles, moves, and difficult situations that arose from my unavailability, our lack of money, and more.</p>\n<p>This was all a lot like battling the Hydra of Lerna: we’d cut off one head, and two would grow back in its place. We’d take a breather for a week, and then here came the wraiths!</p>\n<p>The stress of it all exacerbated a gallstone problem I had. Because of a misdiagnosis, I thought it was something there was no solution for. So even when I wasn’t up in the middle of the night battling monsters demons of the hosting underworld with Sam, I was often awake at night in massive amounts of pain as my gallbladder tried to pass gigantic gallstones. So even then, I’d be sleeping the next day when I needed to be designing websites or networking.</p>\n<p>Throw in a healthy dose of anxiety and some intermittent depression and you get the picture. Instead of growing, our business stagnated. The quest through this dark underworld seemed to have no end in sight. It ruined vacations, stole away family time, punished me physically, hurt our client’s business, and was pushing myself, Jill, and our finances, to our very limits.</p>\n<h3>Death and Rebirth</h3>\n<p>It all seemed to come to a head when the pain of my gallstones became so intense I thought I was going to die. After 2 visits to the Emergency Room and 3 days in the hospital, I gave birth to this baby. They actually saw a larger one than this in the ultrasound beforehand, but my body had apparently broken it up before they removed my gallbladder. I returned home with real-world wounds that would turn into scars, and lighter by one gallbladder and several massive gallstones.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>I left the hospital with a new lease on life. I felt like I’d been resurrected, fighting my way out of the underworld and back to the land of the living. It helped me open up to a completely different approach to hosting and allowed me to see that tiny speck of light that ended up being the doorway out of this underworld made up of the dark side of WordPress and hosting.</p>\n<p>I was able to use my newfound perspective to find some awesome new weapons, and fight my way to that exit. Luckily for you, you can learn from my pain and battles with the underworld.</p>\n<h3>The Road Back: Simplify</h3>\n<p>Illumination was mine! Of the knowledge I gained, one key principle stood out among the rest: <strong>make things as simple as possible, while avoiding single points of failure on mission-critical systems.</strong> Multisite was great for managing all the websites at once, but if one had a problem, they all went down! The same with having a single server to run all our sites: if the server went down, we had the urgency of 30 or 40 clients (back then) all being negatively impacted at once.</p>\n<p>We started by <a href=\"https://wordx.press/how-to-revert-a-wordpress-multisite-to-a-single-site/\">killing our Multisites</a> and traditional hosting setups. Instead of a single Multisite with 1 database where a problem could take down all the sites in the Multisite, we moved to individual WordPress installs for each site. As we pulled each site out of the Multisite and migrated it to our new cloud hosting, we also checked the databases and files thoroughly to ensure they were clean, light, and that we eliminated any cruft that had built up in the database. We also stopped running email and DNS through our web servers. This effectively killed the demons that had moved with us in previous hosting migrations.</p>\n<p>Here’s my recommended do’s and don&#8217;ts for any smaller businesses hosting and maintaining WordPress websites:</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use shared hosting or hosting that uses cPanel</li>\n<li>use Multisite (SPoF)</li>\n<li>put all your sites on 1 server (SPoF)</li>\n<li>use your web server as an email server</li>\n<li>send WordPress transactional emails from your webserver</li>\n<li>use your web server for DNS</li>\n<li>use your hosting company for domain registration</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use cloud hosting with WordPress-optimized stack and custom control panel</li>\n<li>use a bulk-site-management tool</li>\n<li>spread your sites across multiple servers</li>\n<li>use an email suite (Hover, Zoho, G Suite, Office 365)</li>\n<li>use a transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark, MailGun)</li>\n<li>use your registrar for DNS</li>\n<li>use a different registrar for registering domains, than your hosting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following these tips eliminates many single points of failure, simplifies things greatly, and gives you the tools and ability to go right to the source of the problem. Since all your important WordPress functionality isn’t in one place with one point of failure, you can go where the problem is.</p>\n<p>For example, if a client isn’t receiving WooCommerce new order emails from their website, we can quickly go to SendGrid to see why that is and what needs to be done to fix it in an easy to use interface. Try that on a traditional APACHE/cPanel setup that sends your client’s company emails, WordPress emails, etc. all from one place.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>\n<p>We eliminated cPanel and the normal Linux hosting stacks by <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/tevya-wordxpress-success-story/\">moving to CloudWays</a>, which has a nice WordPress setup that they run on top of a number of cloud hosting services such as Google, Amazon, Digital Ocean, and Vultr. They have their own in-house customized stack and management dashboard. CloudWays removed all the normal bloat and potential for problems that comes with it, and really took away most of the pain, hassle, and responsibility of the hosting part of WordPress and for quite cheap.</p>\n<p>On CloudWays, instead of putting all 40+ sites on one server, we split them up, with about 15 &#8211; 18 sites on one small Digital Ocean (and later Vultr) server. This meant that if one site had issues, it wouldn’t take down all our other sites. And even if the issue was bad enough to affect the whole server, or the server had its own issues, only a small portion of our clients would be affected at once.</p>\n<h3>Email Accounts and Transactional Email</h3>\n<p>Additionally, we stopped running email through our servers. Part of simplifying is outsourcing to people/services who can just do it better than you (or that old hosting you’re clinging to because it’s cheap). I love that good WordPress hosts like CloudWays, Flywheel, and Kinsta have no options for you to do this or include built-in services like SendGrid. I slew a lot of email monsters. Using something like SendGrid or Postmark for WordPress and G Suite or Office 365 for email accounts, eliminates tons of headaches.</p>\n<p>We set up WordPress’s emails to go through SendGrid and all our members’ email accounts we migrated to Hover, Google Apps, or Office 365.</p>\n<h3>Bulk-WordPress Management</h3>\n<p>In place of Multisite, we found MainWP and chose it over other options like InfiniteWP. It provided us the bulk-control of Multisite, but without the single point of failure issue. The upside is that it’s fairly inexpensive and runs on a WordPress install, so you control it on your hosting.</p>\n<p>That’s kinda its downside as well. If something goes wrong, it’s on my team and I to run the problem down and fix it. Or we have to go through the cumbersome process of reporting it to the MainWP support team, then providing them access to both the dashboard site and an affected child site. Eventually we decided to move to ManageWP because it’s a hosted platform. That means when something goes wrong, much of the time, it’s on them to fix, and they have access to fix their own platform, plus the logs, etc from our sites.</p>\n<p><strong>MainWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Runs on top of your WP install</li>\n<li>You maintain control</li>\n<li>Familiar interface</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Lifetime extensions purchase option</li>\n<li>GPL licensed</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n<li>Good community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ManageWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More expensive</li>\n<li>Runs on their servers, so problems are largely theirs to deal with</li>\n<li>Less overall responsibility and time drain</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Master of Two Worlds of WordPress</h3>\n<p>Fortunately today there are many awesome hosting options and bulk-management tools that simply weren’t available to me years ago when I started on this journey. After this last, final push, my team and I stood back and waited and rested, expecting more monsters. And occasionally one crawled out of it’s hole. But by and large the underworld was defeated and left far behind. Moving to cloud hosting and simplifying were finally the spell that broke the Fiddler curse and freed us from the underworld. Our business’s core service was stable and safe and running like it should be. We could start growing again! It was such a relief!</p>\n<p>To reiterate some of the illumination gained on my journey: simplify your WordPress websites and hosting through offloading everything you can to experts who do it better, often for cheaper (if you properly calculate the value of your own time). Focus on your super-power whether it be design or development, or just creating solutions on WP with existing plugins and tools. If your super-power isn’t WordPress at all, you can outsource maintenance, content updates, backups and security, plugin and core updates, and much more to a company like <a href=\"https://wordx.press\">WordXpress</a>. I’ve built this company based on the knowledge and tools I learned on my quest.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=My%20%22Hero%27s%20Journey%22%20Through%20the%20Dark%20Underworld%20of%20WordPress%20Hosting&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F&title=My+%26%238220%3BHero%26%238217%3Bs+Journey%26%238221%3B+Through+the+Dark+Underworld+of+WordPress+Hosting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\" title=\"My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\">My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Tevya Washburn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Drupal Gutenberg 1.0 Released, Now Ready for Production Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90376\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-gutenberg-1-0-released-now-ready-for-production-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6201:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg module for Drupal</a>, created by <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, reached the 1.0 milestone earlier this month. It is the first stable release recommended for use in production with Drupal 8.x. </p>\n<p>The 1.0 release removes the Gutenberg-JS dependency and uses Gutenberg core files directly. It is based on Gutenberg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-1st-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 5.6.1</a>, which was released in early May. The module boasts better handling for media files, adding support for title, caption, and alternative text. It also adds an &#8220;Allowed Blocks UI&#8221; to the content type admin UI, so administrators can restrict which blocks show up in the block selector.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re now ready for production sites in the sense that we’ll be more careful with structure changes, will try to do update paths when possible, and will create automated tests for crucial functionality,&#8221; Frontkom project manager Thor Andre Gretland said. &#8220;We’ve solved the blockers for a stable release.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Upgrading the module from RC-1 may require some extra steps, because it is a big jump, taking the Gutenberg library from 4.8.0 to 5.6.1. Users will need to update the database. It is also necessary to navigate to content types and click save to enable Gutenberg again so that it will begin storing the Allowed blocks in the database. If users get notices about invalid blocks, they are advised to try the Attempt Block Recovery option:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/attempt-block-recovery.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s actually a rather large update,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;We were planning to add a couple of last needed features to release our 1.0 version, but ended up using the latest Gutenberg version with several new great features. We’re also using more of the Gutenberg Core, that we’ve been able to use before.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The module still has one critical issue that Frontkom is working on. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3059167\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reusable blocks are not working</a> with the latest release. Users are getting a &#8220;this block is unavailable or deleted&#8221; message when attempting to insert a reusable block. In the meantime, those who require this feature can roll back to RC1 to get it working again.</p>\n<p>So far the Gutenberg module has been well-received. It has been downloaded more than 12,000 times and 494 sites are reported to be using it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Setup <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalgutenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@drupalgutenberg</a> on D8 yesterday (following meeting one of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frontkom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@frontkom</a> at the recent Dutch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CiviCRM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CiviCRM</a> sprint) and was pretty blown away.

Although the library has been slow to gain contributors, it does contain several blocks that are helpful for creating page layouts, such as Content in Columns, Hero Section, Section Wrapper, Section Row, and a Feature Box block. Site administrators can also use the Gutenberg module in combination with Drupal&#8217;s new Layout Builder, which was introduced as a stable module to Drupal 8.7 core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see a valid use case for mixing Drupal Gutenberg with the Drupal layout builder when you might want to create layout templates with the layout builder, and keep the actual content editing in Gutenberg,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;For example you could use the layout builder to define fixed byline elements for author and create date, but leave the actual content creation experience to Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a few limitations to using the two tools together. The only way to use them on the same project is if they deal with different content types.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Drupal Gutenberg takes over the whole node UI, it can have some unexpected effects when used together with Layout Builder,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;That doesn’t mean that they won’t ever &#8216;work&#8217; together. One idea could be using the LB data structure to generate Gutenberg fixed layouts/templates and even save Gutenberg data in a structured way handled by Layout Builder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gretland said his team believes Gutenberg delivers a better editing experience than Layout Builder, as it is a more mature project.

It&#8217;s called <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/devkit/\">DevKit</a>, developed by Chris Wiegman and Jason Stallings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DevKit is a WordPress local development environment that includes SSH Gateway access, push and pull deployments to WP Engine, Command Line Interface commands for the Genesis theme framework and other tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although DevKit has tight integration with WP Engine the software can be used independently of the host. With <a href=\"https://localbyflywheel.com/\">Local by Flywheel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html\">XAMPP</a>, and other tools available, Wiegman explains what motivated him to create a new solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working on the perfect WordPress developer environment since I learned about Vagrant in 2013,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it was never my full-time job, I could never take it to the next level. DevKit gives me the power to do that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallings added, &#8220;We wanted to build a kick ass set of tools for developers building on WP Engine. That’s been our mission from the start, build something that all developers want to use (including us)!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As what for what sets DevKit apart from the others, &#8220;I think our architecture is very different from both tools,&#8221; Stallings said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Similar to Docker Engine, DevKit CLI is the interface to DevKit. So when we build the GUI it will 100% complement the CLI, and the two can be used interchangeably. This will enable us to build other interfaces in the future too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DevKit provides the following features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Container-based local development environment</li><li>SSH Gateway access</li><li>Push and pull deployments to WP Engine</li><li>Preview your local site with others via ngrok</li><li>PHP version selector</li><li>Email testing client</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Local SSH &amp; WP-CLI</li><li>Genesis Framework WP-CLI commands</li><li>phpmyadmin</li><li>webgrind</li><li>Varnish</li><li>HTTPS Proxy</li><li>xdebug</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, DevKit&#8217;s user interface is command line only with plans to add a GUI later this year. It&#8217;s available for free and is in open beta for Mac and Linux. Those interested in participating in the open beta can sign up on the <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/devkit/\">DevKit landing page</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:12:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Former npm, Inc.

Although centralization has some advantages for usability and reliability, success can be expensive when a centralized service becomes popular. She described the events leading up to npm&#8217;s incorporation in 2013. The registry was down more than it was up in October 2013 and npm needed money.</p>\n<p>npm&#8217;s owner took seed funding from a VC firm and the Node project continued to give npm special privileges. Developers perpetuated this by continuing to use npm, as over time it had come to define developers&#8217; expectations in serving JavaScript packages. Silverio discusses some of the consequences of npm coming under private control, how developers now have no input into registry policies or how disputes are resolved. </p>\n<p>Presumably speaking from her intimate knowledge of the company&#8217;s inner workings, Silverio describes how VC-funding turned npm Inc. into a financial instrument.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Financial instruments are contracts about money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;npm Inc, the company that owns our language ecosystem, is a thing that might as well be a collection of pork bellies, as far as its owners are concerned. They make contracts with each other and trade bits of it around. npm Inc. is a means for turning money into more money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio contends that JavaScript&#8217;s package registry should not be privately controlled and that centralization is a burden that will inevitably lead to private control because the servers cost money. </p>\n<p>Her sharp criticism of centralized package management leads into her announcement of a federated, decentralized package registry called <a href=\"https://github.com/entropic-dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Entropic</a> that she created with former npm colleague Chris Dickinson and more than a dozen contributors. The project is Apache 2.0 licensed and its creators are working in cooperation with the <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OpenJS Foundation</a>. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Warming my heart right now: how many former npm-ers are contributing to entropic &lt;3</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ceej is on vacation (@ceejbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceejbot/status/1136551537835032577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Entropic comes with its own CLI, and offers a new file-centric publication API. All packages published to the registry are public and developers are encouraged to use something like the GitHub Package Registry if they need to control access to packages. The project is just over a month old and is not ready for use. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it’s right that the pendulum is swinging away from centralization and I want to lend my push to the swing,&#8221; Silverio said. The last decade has been about consolidation and monolithic services, but the coming decade is going to be federated. Federation spreads out costs. It spreads out control. It spreads out policy-making. It hands control of your slice of our language ecosystem to you. My hope is that by giving Entropic away, I’ll help us take our language commons back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management/blob/master/essay.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Economics of Package Management</a> essay is available on GitHub. Check out the video of the presentation from JSConf EU below.

BuddyPress users will now be able to set their passwords using WordPress&#8217; interface on the registration page and on the user&#8217;s general settings page. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it will look like in the templates:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\'s how it looks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4fd.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/g8DknNpUKl\">pic.twitter.com/g8DknNpUKl</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; imath (@imath) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imath/status/1129668922024845313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>By default, BuddyPress will generate a strong password, but the user can still edit it, if necessary.

As a result of the password control update, the src/bp-templates/bp-nouveau/js/password-verify.js template is scheduled to be deprecated and deleted in BuddyPress 6.0.0, so developers will want to take note if using the bp-nouveau-password-verify script as a dependency for custom password control implementations.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress 5.0 also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-display-debug-info-in-the-new-site-health-info-screen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adds BP-specific debug into to the Site Health Info screen</a> that was introduced in WordPress 5.2.

Web development agency 10UP has a <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/theme-scaffold\">Theme</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/plugin-scaffold\">Plugin</a> repo template that is available for anyone to use.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 5.2.2 Release Date Changed</h2>\n<p>WordPress 5.2.2 was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/01/some-changes-to-the-5-2-2-release-schedule/\">originally scheduled</a> to be released on June 13th, but the release team has decided to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/06/dev-chat-summary-05-june/\">push the date back</a>. Tickets that are slated for WordPress 5.3 that meet the requirements to be in a minor release will be merged into 5.2.2. The new release date is Tuesday, June 18th, a few days before WordCamp EU.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp US After Party Is Now Wordfest</h2>\n<p>There won&#8217;t be a big after party at the conclusion of WordCamp US this year. Instead, organizers are <a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/2019/06/07/wordfest-will-be-held-at-city-museum/\">hosting WordFest</a> on Friday, November 1, 2019, at <a href=\"https://www.citymuseum.org/\">City Museum in St. Louis</a>. According to organizers, the party doesn&#8217;t always have to be at the conclusion of the event thus the name change.</p>\n<h2>How to Use and Create Reusable Block Templates</h2>\n<p>Justin Tadlock has <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/reusable-blocks-as-templates\">published a tutorial</a> that explains how to create, use, import, and export reusable block templates in WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of this is not intuitive at this point and might take some digging for someone not intimately familiar with all the block editor features. But, this is an extremely powerful feature that I’m sure will become more useful in the future. I can even see things like theme authors sharing reusable blocks to help users build out certain page designs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing other people share their reusable blocks or templates. One of the beautiful things about the new editor is that it doesn&#8217;t require a developer to sort blocks into a particular layout and then save it as a reusable block that can be shared.</p>\n<h2>C02 May Be the Cause of Feeling Drowsy During Conference Sessions</h2>\n<p>I always thought it had something to do with lunch but I&#8217;ve felt drowsy before then.

For example, some of the information in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/wordpress-weekly\">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/icymi\">In Case You Missed It</a> posts never changes and instead of manually entering it each time, it&#8217;s nice to use a template where only a few changes are necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other day, I was wondering if I could use the reusable block feature in Gutenberg to replace the plugin. Justin Tadlock reached out and provided me a reusable block template JSON file that I imported into Gutenberg. By the way, if you successfully import a block into WordPress, the block won&#8217;t appear until you manually refresh the page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reusable block template approach works fairly well. However, I noticed that I was unable to add a block inside the reusable block. When I tried, a red line was displayed and any blocks that were inserted were removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Red Means No</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that reusable blocks are meant to be restricted templates where changes are distributed across a site to wherever the block is displayed. But it&#8217;s still a bummer that I can&#8217;t add a block inside the template for a singular purpose if a need arises. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing I noticed is that reusable blocks are custom post types. While there is a link to manage them within the reusable block selector, there isn&#8217;t a dedicated item within the admin menu. Unless you know the location of the management link, adding and managing them can be a bit more time-consuming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a quick shortcut to the reusable block management screen, add this to the URL after your domain name. wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I&#8217;ll experiment with reusable blocks a bit more but as long as they&#8217;re not changing often, I believe they&#8217;ll make a nice replacement for the Post Templates plugin. What use cases have you encountered where reusable blocks were the solution?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 02:13:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Branch Continuous Integration Service Selected for TinySeed Startup Accelerator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90611\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/branch-continuous-integration-service-selected-for-tinyseed-startup-accelerator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4298:\"<p><a href=\"https://branchci.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Branch</a>, a Docker-based continuous integration service for WordPress, has been selected for <a href=\"https://tinyseed.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TinySeed&#8217;s startup accelerator</a>. The company was founded by Peter Suhm who is also the creator of <a href=\"https://wppusher.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a>, a plugin that lets developers install and update WordPress themes and plugins directly from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.</p>\n<p>TinySeed, founded by <a href=\"https://robwalling.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Walling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vollset.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Einar Vollset</a>, is a remote accelerator that focuses on providing enough funding for early-stage SaaS founders to live for a year and focus full-time on their startups. It advertises itself as &#8220;the first startup accelerator designed for bootstrappers.&#8221; TinySeed is unique in that it does not have a bias against single founders. The website states that the majority of successful $1m-$30m SaaS companies that TinySeed is connected with were started by founders working alone. </p>\n<p>Branch fits the bill as a SaaS company with a single founder and no employees. As part of the investment terms, TinySeed invests $120k for the first founder (plus $20k per additional founder) in exchange for 8-15% equity. If founders do not need the money for living expenses they are free to spend it on growing the business. Both Branch and WP Pusher are included in Suhm&#8217;s participation in TinySeed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Pusher was doing just enough to pay my bills living in a fairly cheap city (Glasgow), but not enough to pay a full time developer salary,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;However, I didn&#8217;t spend much time on WP Pusher in the past few years and was working part time for other companies &#8211; mainly <a href=\"https://www.timekit.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Timekit</a> as a backend developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm said the TinySeed investment will allow him to work full time on Branch and WP Pusher for at least a year or two without having to worry about making a salary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I may also decide to make a hire during the program, but I want the product to be a little bit more mature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In terms of the roadmap, I&#8217;ll be able to focus more on building the best tool and less about making a lot of money in the beginning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Branch and WP Pusher are fairly unique products in the WordPress space. Suhm said he sees most of his competition coming from continuous integration services that are not tailored to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, my biggest competitor at the moment is probably manual labor &#8211; WordPress developers testing and deploying everything manually,&#8221; Suhm said.</p>\n<p>TinySeed received approximately 900 applications from which they will select 10-15 companies for participation in 2019. Co-founder Rob Walling has knowledge of the WordPress ecosystem, as he previously <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-closes-1-2m-in-series-a-financing/\">invested in WP Engine&#8217;s 2011 round of funding</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Peter has a distinct advantage with Branch in that he&#8217;s building on the audience, customer base, and domain knowledge he&#8217;s developed with WP Pusher,&#8221; TinySeed co-founder Rob Walling said. &#8220;His methodical approach to shipping code and content every week has been a good signal for us that he&#8217;s pushing the product forward, as well as a key factor in building Branch&#8217;s traction in the space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Branch is joining a handful of other SaaS companies that have already been selected for 2019, including <a href=\"https://clientsherpa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ClientSherpa</a>, <a href=\"https://gatherit.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gather</a>, <a href=\"https://simsaas.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SimSaaS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reimbi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reimbi</a>, and <a href=\"https://castos.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Castos</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:31:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: Automattic Adopts Alex Mills’ Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90583\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-adopts-alex-mills-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4656:\"<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/taking-care-of-alexs-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that a team inside the company will be adopting <a href=\"https://alex.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Mills</a>&#8216; plugins and continuing their development and support. Mills, also known around the web as @Viper007Bond, was a WordPress core contributor and prolific plugin developer who passed away in February 2019 after a battle with Leukemia. </p>\n<p>At one time last year, Mills was the primary author for and contributor to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181231163744/https://profiles.wordpress.org/viper007bond/#content-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 40 plugins</a> hosted on WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/viper007bond/#content-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">current collection</a> seems to have been pared back to 17 of his most popular plugins. According to <a href=\"http://wptally.com/?wpusername=viper007bond\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stats from WP Tally</a>, these 17 plugins have a cumulative download count of 138,665,603 and a cumulative rating of 4.55 out of 5 stars.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since all of my plugins are open-source, they are free to be forked by reputable authors in the WordPress community. It would mean a lot to have my legacy go on,&#8221; Mills said in his <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/18/leukemia-has-won/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">farewell post</a> earlier this year. The plugins are all free without any pro versions or monetization efforts attached to them.</p>\n<p>“I’d never monetize any of my plugins,” Mills told the Tavern after his popular Regenerate Thumbnails plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/regenerate-thumbnails-plugin-passes-5-million-downloads-rewrite-in-the-works\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed 5 million downloads</a> in 2017. “I write them for fun not profit. It would be a conflict of interest anyway due to my employment at Automattic.”</p>\n<p>Regenerate Thumbnails is active on more than a million WordPress sites and <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/01/29/my-regenerate-thumbnails-plugin-passes-10m-downloads/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed the 10 million downloads milestone</a> in January 2019. It has already been downloaded more than 7,000 times today and has regularly received 3K-12k downloads per day throughout 2019. </p>\n<p>The enduring popularity of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> is a testament to Mills&#8217; commitment to writing future-proof plugins. What started as a small plugin to fix a client&#8217;s problem in 2008 quickly became an indispensable utility for millions of WordPress users transitioning between themes with different image sizes. For those users who could never write their own script to generate new thumbnail sizes, Mills&#8217; plugin was a little piece of time-saving magic that exemplifies the significant contributions plugin developers can make when they write and share code that solves a common problem.</p>\n<p>Automattic plans to fork each of Mills&#8217; GitHub repositories and will add them to the Automattic Github account. The team behind this effort is also adding the following paragraph to each plugin&#8217;s readme file:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In February 2019 Alex Mills, the author of this plugin, <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/02/27/from-alexs-family/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed away</a>. He leaves behind a number of plugins which will be maintained by Automattic and members of the WordPress community. If this plugin is useful to you please consider <a href=\"https://alex.blog/2019/03/13/in-memory-of-alex-donation-link-update/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">donating to the Oregon Health and Science University</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic will also be answering support queries on the forums and the team is open to receiving help from other members of the WordPress community in maintaining and supporting Mills&#8217; plugins. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In times gone by authors left works of music, novels, poetry, and letters on their passing,&#8221; Donncha Ó Caoimh said on the Automattic Engineering blog. &#8220;They were static works of art frozen in time.

Site owners can select &#8220;Googlebot Smartphone&#8221; as the user-agent on the rich results testing tool to see if their sites are prepared for mobile-first indexing. The tool is still in beta, so not all rich results and error types are supported yet. </p>\n<p>If your page supports rich results, you will see a confirmation and can click through to view the HTML. Certain rich result types will display a preview of how the result might appear in Google Search. If multiple result layouts are available, the tool will also let you drill down into the different layouts for both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-12.10.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you get a result that says &#8220;Page not eligible for rich results known by this test&#8221; when you know that you have the structured data in place, it could be because the beta version of this tool only supports a subset of rich result types.

The position was created and awarded to de Valk <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\">earlier this year</a>. Not only was it a new position, but it also expanded the leadership roles in the WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://joost.blog/marketing-wordpress-first-steps/\">making progress</a>, de Valk didn&#8217;t feel as though he was fulfilling the leadership aspect of his role. &#8220;My experience over the last few months made me feel that while I was doing things and getting things done, I certainly wasn’t leadership. I don’t want to pretend I have a say in things I don’t have a say in,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having a clear definition of what marketing means and having people within the project on the same page contributed to his decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s a stark difference between where I thought I would be in the organization in this role, and where I am actually finding myself now,&#8221; de Valk said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even things that every outsider would consider marketing (release posts,  about pages) are created without even so much as talking to me or others in the marketing team. Because I felt left out of all these decisions, I feel I can’t <em>be</em> a marketing lead.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also cited a lack of clarity surrounding his position, &#8220;I’ve been asked dozens of times on Twitter, Facebook and at WordCamps why I now work for Automattic, which of course I don’t but that is the perception for a lot of people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On other occasions, I seem to be the token non-Automattician, which I’m also uncomfortable with.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to taking a toll from failing to fulfill the position, de Valk plans to take an extended vacation during the Summer and when he returns, focus 100% of his efforts on Yoast and his Chief Product Officer role. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://joost.blog/why-im-stepping-down-from-my-wordpress-marketing-role/#comment-644\">commented</a> on de Valk&#8217;s article thanking him for being willing to try new things and for his passion, impatience, and drive to improve WordPress. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2019 17:57:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Take Back Your Web: Tantek Çelik’s Call to Action to Join the Independent Web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90416\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/take-back-your-web-tantek-celiks-call-to-action-to-join-the-independent-web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4246:\"<p><a href=\"https://tantek.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tantek Çelik</a>, Web Standards Lead at Mozilla and co-founder of IndieWebCamp, delivered an inspirational talk titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/336343886\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take Back Your Web</a>&#8221; at the most recent <a href=\"https://beyondtellerrand.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beyond tellerrand</a> conference in Düsseldorf, Germany. He opened the presentation with a litany of Facebook&#8217;s wrongdoings, taking the world&#8217;s largest social network to task for its role in increasing polarization, amplifying rage, and spreading conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>Çelik challenged the audience to &#8220;stop scrolling Facebook,&#8221; because its algorithms are designed to manipulate users&#8217; emotions and behaviors. He noted that it is the only social network with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Wikipedia page dedicated to its criticism</a>. This massive document has a dizzying number of references, which Wikipedia says &#8220;may be too long to read and navigate comfortably.&#8221; As an alternative to scrolling Facebook, Celik encouraged attendees to spend time doing nothing, an activity that can be uncomfortable yet productive.  </p>\n<p>The &#8220;Take Back Your Web&#8221; presentation is a call to action to join the independent web by owning your own domain, content, social connections, and reading experience. Celik recommends a number of IndieWeb services and tools to empower users to take control of their experiences on the web. </p>\n<p>With a free site hosted on GitHub, he said the costs of owning your own domain are less than owning a phone or having internet service. Suggestions like this are targeted at developers who share Twitter names instead of domains and post articles on Medium. Setting up a site on GitHub is not a simple task for most. That&#8217;s why networks like WordPress.com, along with hosts that provide instant WordPress sites, are so important for enabling average internet users to create their own websites.</p>\n<p>Celik referenced Matthias Ott&#8217;s recent article &#8220;<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Into the Personal-Website-Verse</a>,&#8221; highlighting the section about the value of learning new technologies by implementing them on your own website: &#8220;A personal website is also a powerful playground to tinker with new technologies and discover your powers.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the few places developers can expand their skills and make mistakes without the pressure to have everything working. Ott enumerates the many benefits of people having their own enduring home on the web and encourages developers to use their powers to make this a reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As idealistic as this vision of the Web might seem these days, it isn’t that far out of reach. Much of what’s needed, especially the publishing part, is already there. It’s also not as if our sites weren’t already connected in one way or another. Yet much of the discussions and establishment of connections, of that social glue that holds our community together – besides community events in real life, of course –, mostly happens on social media platforms at the moment. But: this is a choice. If we would make the conscious decision to find better ways to connect our personal sites and to enable more social interaction again, and if we would then persistently work on this idea, then we could, bit by bit, influence the development of Web technologies into this direction. What we would end up with is not only a bunch of personal websites but a whole interconnected personal-website-verse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out Çelik&#8217;s <a href=\"http://tantek.com/presentations/2019/05/indieweb/#cover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">slides</a> for the presentation and the recording below for a little bit of inspiration to re-evaluate your relationship with social networks, create your own site, or revive one that has been neglected.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2019 21:50:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 7.4 Adds Business Hours Block and Ability to Share Content Through WhatsApp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90503\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-4-adds-business-hours-block-and-ability-to-share-content-through-whatsapp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2229:\"<p>Jetpack 7.4 is <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/06/04/7-4-maintenance/\">now available</a> and includes a new Business Hours block.

These animations can sometimes more clearly communicate changes, particularly in relationship to the action of moving or reordering items on a page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though the instant transformation of the interface is accurate it may not be the clearest expression of the change that just occurred,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The relationship between intention and effect might become harder to grasp. Motion can be a great aid in communicating relationships and clarifying the changes experienced in a more intuitive way.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This creates an interesting choice for an interface designer. Although instantaneous changes are possible to implement, they may require more time for the user&#8217;s brain to process. In the case of an editor, any added cognitive processing can pull a user out of the flow of writing. Ventura sets a good practical rule of thumb for determining if an animation adds value to an interaction:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One could say that an animation is worth being present if the clarity of change it provides is greater than the time it would take to adjust cognitively to the new state in its absence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ventura illustrates this concept with two video demos in his post &#8211; one showing how block reordering currently looks in WordPress&#8217; editor and a second with an example of how it could be improved with subtle, tasteful animations. It&#8217;s an early prototype but very convincing:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Gutenberg was still in the selling phase before being merged into core, some said that moving forward was simply a matter of retraining your muscle memory to work with the new editor. However, at that time there were still a number of markedly flawed interactions that didn&#8217;t feel natural and were even jarring for the user. The legacy editor didn&#8217;t have blocks to reorder or many of the other interactions introduced by the new block paradigm, so there wasn&#8217;t much prior context for comparison.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">User reviews</a> have complained about the cognitive load that Gutenberg adds and have continued to identify problematic interactions with the core blocks. Unfortunately, in many heated exchanges that took place in comments and discussions prior to WordPress 5.0&#8217;s release, these concerns were often brushed aside as coming from people who were resistant to change.</p>\n<p>Many of the reviewers may not have had the right words to communicate what it was they were experiencing, but the cognitive load may be one of the strongest reasons why the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin has more than 5 million active installs. </p>\n<p>Matías Ventura&#8217;s proposal to add motion to express change in the editor has the potential to solve some of these unintuitive interactions. The Gutenberg repository now has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15922\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> dedicated to exploring and discussing the use of motion to add clarity to the action of reordering blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/using-motion-to-express-change\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ventura&#8217;s post</a> is an encouraging read that demonstrates the thought and craftsmanship that go into architecting an interface that is required to meet the needs of millions of users. If you have been impatient with Gutenberg&#8217;s progress, as I have been, it&#8217;s important to recognize that these kinds of refinements to interactions take time to percolate. Replicating realistic motion comes from contemplating how we interact with the known world and understanding how that informs users&#8217; digital expectations. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2019 04:43:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"HeroPress: Ugyen’s Roadmap to WordPress Contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:156:\"https://heropress.com/essays/ugyens-roadmap-to-wordpress-contributions/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ugyens-roadmap-to-wordpress-contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44456:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/060419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The most valuable service is the one rendered to our fellow man.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#dzo\">འབྲི་རྩོམ་འདི་རྫོང་ཁ་ན་ལུ་ཡ་ཡོདཔ་ཨིན།</a></p>\n<p>Ugyen Dorji is from Bhutan, the landlocked country situated between two giant neighbors, India to the south and China to the north. Ugyen works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the robust Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans” and his work ethic shows with managing WordPress translation projects for his Plugin ’All-in-One WP Migration.’  Ugyen also keeps multi-language support for WordPress; furthermore the plugin is now translated into 42 languages with more on the way.</p>\n<h3>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</h3>\n<p>Life is a struggle &#8211; it is a mixture of success and failure which can come in any venture and that too late and sometimes most unexpectedly people lose heart after a failure; but a person who takes failure in his/her stride and continues his effort for success in long run in the word of EL Kerten means “The secret of success is knowing whom to blame for your failure.”</p>\n<p>Back in 2016, he had been looking for new working place after his former cloud company got shattered with some financial crisis, he has looked for a new job. For which he has tried his best and one fine day he makes it to an interview &#8211; where he has been triggered with WordPress questionnaires. On that moment he has no proper answer for interviewers saying big number to interviewers, though he has basic knowledge about WordPress. After that day, just sat in his room with silence and made up his mind to learn and get skilled himself with WordPress wisdom,  watching cities from his window receiving cool air, and said himself</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I will make my career with WordPress and it will be my bread and butter”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a few months, he received a call from ServMask Inc, who developed a great plugin called   &#8220;All-in-One WP Migration&#8221; which made his dream come true like an angle ServMask Inc blessed his dream to make his living with WordPress. Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>Ugyen’s First WordCamp Experience</h3>\n<p>WordCamp is a genuine spotlight for plugin and theme developers to reach WordPress users and website developers. It’s a glorious atmosphere where many incredible talks about WordPress take place. The “tribe” meetings are a phenomenal moment for aspiring computer engineers, content writers and developers to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was an essential day for Ugyen and ServMask because their sponsorship of the event delivered them the opportunity to connect with our active WordPress users and showcase their appreciation on better quality of WordPress plugin.</p>\n<h3>Contributor Day</h3>\n<p>The first day of WordCamp is Contributor Day. Ugyen associated with a community team and got to share a conversation with WordPress folks from all over the world. Community communication is the ground root of WordCamp and WordPress meetups, giving him all the chance to share and manifest what WordPress does and  how it is used. He also addressed encouraging more speakers and WordPress members to nurture their experience and whereby he could support new organizers to continue and contribute to building the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n<h3>Conference Day</h3>\n<p>Conference Day is the main event of WordCamp and is held on the second day. Ugyen was taking care of a Photo Booth for people to snap their memories. I think this was a great idea to capture the memories of WordCamp for attendees, speakers, and organizers.</p>\n<p>The foremost intention of the conference day is the presentations that take place throughout the day. Ugyen had a great moment to attend various talks which were very beneficial for developers, entrepreneurs, firms, and young startups firms. What holds in Ugyen&#8217;s mind is a plan that exhibits leveraging website content has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business extension.</p>\n<h3>How Ugyen became WordPress Meetup Thimphu Co-Organizer</h3>\n<p>Following October 2016, Ugyen came over about WordPress Meetup Bangkok and WordCamp Bangkok 2018. From that onwards, the importance of WordPress Meetup catches on his mind to introduce WordPress to his home country and cities. The foremost incidence that clicks on his mind was on WordPress Translation Day 3 on September 30, 2017, during WordPress Meetup Bangkok where he has seen his locale Dzongkha was in lowest percentage comparing to another locale status on WordPress Core Translation. Later in WordCamp Bangkok 2018 Contributors day when he met with WordPress Folks and WordPress Community, Meetup Organizer from many countries.</p>\n<p>WordPress Meetup Thimphu is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup covering everything related to WordPress and keeping our Bhutanese Gross National Happiness four pillars in mind with aims to preserve and promote our unique culture and national language. WordPress Meetup implies for individuals and all people who love WordPress and want to contribute and share their knowledge and have experience in meeting new faces and for networking. Ugyen’s Specific focus on encouraging local and international language WordPress bloggers and help startup companies to grow their assets with WordPress and share what he has learned from WordPress with his Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Ugyen’s First WordPress Meetup Thimphu was a huge success within his community coinciding with WordPress Main event WordPress Translation Day 4.  Ugyen would take a more vital role in preserving his national language by making use of WordPress actively by our Dzongkha bloggers, online Dzongkha news, government websites so that Bhutanese WordPress core contributors could hand over to our next generation very proudly.</p>\n<p>What we have achieved :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Done WordPress Core Translation for our locale Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>New Translation Contributor for our WordPress Core Translation for Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>Participated in <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org\">Global WordPress Translation Day 4</a> Livestream.</li>\n<li>Invited WordPress Experts from other countries to <a href=\"http://wpbhutan.slack.com\">http://wpbhutan.slack.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Invited WordPress Meetup Thimphu members to <a href=\"http://wpbhutan.slack.com\">http://wpbhutan.slack.com</a> to discuss more on WordPress related topics and for helpline on WordPress for Bhutanese WordPress users and wordpress.org login for new users.</li>\n<li>Speaker of the event Tenzin Namgyel Senior ICT officer from DDC WordPress Local Manager and General Translation Editor for our locale Dzongkha.</li>\n<li>Good meal and tea with great place to host at <a href=\"http://ariyabhutan.com/\">Ariya Hotel</a></li>\n<li>Introduction of a member for networking.</li>\n<li>Became a part of<a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/the-team/\"> Global WordPress Translation Day 4 team.</a></li>\n<li>Event Sponsored by ServMask Inc and Helped by Dzongkha Development Commission with Language Experts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>WordPress Future Road Plans</h3>\n<p>“The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today’s work superbly well” so that we can put all our effort, then we’ll see a very good result and success will surely be yours. No men can hope to have a very successful life but there will be one or two in exception in this earthly world in thousand cases of this matter which results strong determination can help to attain success. Therefore with Ugyen’s determination here are some of his road plans for WordPress.</p>\n<p>For WordPress Meetup: Ugyen’s next plan is to visit the language universities and teach them to blog in Dzongkha using WordPress. He said, “ We have plans to gather a group of active Bhutanese WordPress Bloggers and host panel talks to extend the beauty of Bhutan and unique culture of Bhutan to outside nations. And also one of the WordPress Main Events: Introduction to Open Source is in a process to be host soon. His Majesty the fourth King of Bhutan once said, “the future of our nation lies in the hands of our children.” Therefore Ugyen works to focus more on youth to enhance their WordPress Skills.</p>\n<p>For WordCamp: WordCamp Thimphu is my goal &#8211; to reach and invite more WordPress Experts as speakers of the main event and support Bhutanese to grow their career with WordPress. WordCamp Asia is in the process to kick start in 2020 and become one of the WordCamp Co-organizer among 41 WordCamp Asia Co-Organizers.</p>\n<p>To WordPress lovers &#8211; “If you want to be

href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordproof-timestamp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof Timestamp</a> is a new free plugin that bridges the WordPress and blockchain communities in an approachable, user-friendly way. It gives users the ability to timestamp their posts and pages to demonstrate transparency and claim ownership of content.</p>\n<p>WordProof works with any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOS.IO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EOSIO</a> blockchain to create the timestamp and provides a custom certificate link with a frontend pop-up to display it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/timestamp-certificate.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin adds a &#8220;View the blockchain certificate&#8221; link under each post or page, which pops up the URL, title, content, timestamp information, and will soon also display revisions. Users will be able to browse through different timestamps to view the changes. </p>\n<p>WordProof Timestamp was first created by <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, a WordPress agency based in Amsterdam. This is the same company that recently open sourced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, a package that allows developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. Development has now been passed on to a dedicated WordProof team that is funded by Tenos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been working and investing with blockchain as a hobby since 2013,&#8221; Van Ons founder Sebastiaan van der Lans said. &#8220;After we built the <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-compliance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP GDPR Compliance</a> plugin and started working Laraberg, I am trying to work more and more on open source projects. From my point of view, WordPress + blockchain could not only democratize publishing but also doing business as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Lans said he expects that any type of publishing website or any site with &#8220;Terms &#038; Conditions&#8221; pages can benefit from timestamping. It&#8217;s especially useful in mediating claims of plagiarism and content theft. WordProof has no transaction costs and is almost instant (0.5s). Van der Lans said it was important for this solution to have no transaction fees, since it is fundamental to proving the author&#8217;s identity and the integrity of the content.</p>\n<p>Right now the plugin offers the ability to timestamp an entire article, including the title and content. Block level time-stamping is not on the roadmap, but the team is open to adding it in the future. They are currently looking into time-stamping media files and legal documents.</p>\n<p>After launching the plugin in beta, a team of 60 testers, from both the WordPress and EOS.IO blockchain communities, gave feedback that led to the creation of a WordProof Wizard to make it easier for users to set up the required accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our testers&#8217; main concern: it was too difficult to create an account on the blockchain and download and set-up a blockchain wallet afterwards,&#8221; Van Ons head of product Jelle van der Schoot said. &#8220;Therefore, we invested a lot of time into improving the UI/UX of the entire process (downloading the plugin, creating a blockchain account, downloading and setting up a wallet, timestamping).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The wizard supports both Telos and EOS and guides users through the process of setting up an account directly inside the WordPress dashboard. The process takes approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordproof-wizard.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe the WordProof Wizard can have a massive impact on the onboarding of new users to the blockchain in general, but more specifically to the Telos and EOS blockchains,&#8221; van der Schoot said.</p>\n<p>Timestamping posts is by no means a new idea. There are already several free WordPress plugins that have similar functionality and work with various blockchain technology, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Blockchain</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stampd-io-blockchain-stamping/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STAMPD.IO</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/po-et/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Po.et</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mingrana-wp-to-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mingrana WP to Blockchain</a>. WordProof is different from many of them in that it doesn&#8217;t use a centralized middle layer.</p>\n<p>The team behind the plugin is working on more tools that bring blockchain features to WordPress and will soon be adding cryptographically secured decentralized WordPress hosting to the <a href=\"https://wordproof.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof lineup</a>. van der Lans will also be speaking about more of the benefits of timestamping content with the blockchain at WordCamp Europe in his presentation titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/from-wordpress-to-blockchain-the-future-is-100-open-source/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">From WordPress to blockchain: the future is 100% open source</a>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the project, you can follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordProofio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof on Twitter</a> or join the <a href=\"https://t.me/WordProof\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof Telegram channel</a> where users can also find support for the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jun 2019 21:56:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: FreeCodeCamp Moves Off of Medium after being Pressured to Put Articles Behind Paywalls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90381\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/freecodecamp-moves-off-of-medium-after-being-pressured-to-put-articles-behind-paywalls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5824:\"<p>After four years of publishing on Medium, <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeCodeCamp</a> is migrating all of its articles to its own open source publishing platform, a modified version of <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ghost</a>. The platform allows approved authors to cross-post their blog articles on the new <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeCodeCamp News</a> site for free, without any ads.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium was a great place to publish because it helped a lot of people discover your articles. But the community has outgrown Medium,&#8221; FreeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium has shifted to a paywall model where they mainly recommend paywalled articles, then encourage visitors to pay to get around their paywall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the same time, not much of the traffic to Medium articles comes from Medium itself. Most of it comes from Google and social media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the detailed public <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/we-just-moved-off-of-medium-and-onto-freecodecamp-news-heres-how-you-can-use-it/279929\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on the FreeCodeCamp forums, Larson said he noticed his articles started to get less distribution after he decided that putting them behind a paywall would not be compatible with the mission of his organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As of 2019, Medium won’t give you much &#8216;distribution&#8217; within their platform unless you’re willing to put your articles to be behind their paywall,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;At the same time, if you do put your article behind their paywall, you’re limiting your readership to just the people who have the resources to pay. This is at odds with the goals of the freeCodeCamp community. We want to make these learning resources as widely available as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an email to blog authors who had published on FreeCodeCamp&#8217;s Medium publication, Larson elaborated on more serious concerns that he had with the platform&#8217;s approach to his organization. Oleg Isonen, one of the blog authors, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1134475953470656513/photo/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published the contents of the email</a>, which was later deleted at Larson&#8217;s request.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But over the past year Medium had become more aggressive toward us,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;They have pressured us to put our articles behind their paywalls. We refused. So they tried to buy us. (Which makes no sense. We&#8217;re a public charity.) We refused. Then they started threatening us with a lawyer.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-31-at-1.48.01-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many of those who read the email <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1134511135686877184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">encouraged Larson to write a follow-up article</a>, as Medium&#8217;s tactics towards publishers are a matter of legitimate public concern, both to those who use the platform and readers who support the company through subscriptions. </p>\n<p>Larson responded, confirming that he sent the email but that he wanted to move on from the situation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This email was intended only for Oleg and a few of our other authors. I have messaged him asking to delete it.

The articles will still be available on Medium, but from now on freeCodeCamp plans to publish on its own platform. The site promises users full control, better analytics, AMP support, and a better reader experience that doesn&#8217;t require people to sign in or pay to read articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that all of us in the developer community can start our own blogs on the open web, then use community tools like freeCodeCamp News to raise awareness of them,&#8221; Larson said. </p>\n<p>Medium abruptly changed course in 2017 to become a publisher of subscription-based content, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scrapping the ad-driven revenue model</a> without notifying publishers ahead of time. Many publications that had invested heavily in building a following on Medium were forced to leave after discovering that the company did not have their best interests in mind. Medium&#8217;s new paywalled content model, which CEO Ev Williams claims is &#8220;a different, bolder approach&#8221; targeted at fixing what is broken with media, could not sustain publishers who were convinced to join the platform in its earlier days. </p>\n<p>FreeCodeCamp joins a wave of other publications that are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/publishers-are-moving-back-to-wordpress-after-short-experiments-with-medium\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">moving back to WordPress</a> and other open source platforms. This trend is set to continue as Medium&#8217;s obtrusive popups and poor reader experience drive readers away from the content hosted there.

Starting a new page from scratch may be overwhelming for those who don&#8217;t have a vision for how to tastefully put blocks together to lay out the page. This is a problem that this experimental plugin may be able to solve.</p>\n<p>Full Site Editing currently provides three custom blocks for post content, templates, and a blog posts listing. The Blog Posts Listing block expands upon core&#8217;s Latest Posts block to include an excerpt and meta information.</p>\n<p>The plugin is available in the WordPress Plugin Directory, although it is somewhat difficult to find when searching in the admin plugin installer. The most recent 0.1.1 version of the plugin seems to be broken, but if you roll back to the initial release, you can see some of the page template experiments. After activating the plugin, navigate to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong> and a new modal with a template selector should pop up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-1.28.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The templates come pre-filled with demo content and images, so the user doesn&#8217;t have to think about how to configure the blocks to match the demo. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/full-site-editing-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The functionality in Full Site Editing is being developed for use on WordPress.com. It makes sense for a network that regularly onboards new bloggers and site owners. It is in the company&#8217;s best interest to deliver the fastest possible site creation experience, rather than have new users get frustrated and confused about how to get started. </p>\n<p>A template selector for creating new pages could also be useful for the broader WordPress community. Plugin developer Jeffrey Carandang tested Full Site Editing and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phpbits/status/1133677497789194240\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that it might be useful to add this functionality to Gutenberg with custom hooks so that developers can add their own custom templates. This would make guiding users through the new theme setup process much easier for theme shops.</p>\n<p>Automattic has a label on the Calypso repository dedicated to categorizing issues in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BGoal%5D%20Full%20Site%20Editing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full site editing</a> project. The plugin is going to be enabled on a small set of sites for <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/33163\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initial testing</a>. There are quite a few issues that still need to be ironed out, including things like preventing users from deleting the header and footer and finalizing the theme used with the plugin. At the moment, the plugin seems to be tailored specifically to the Twenty Nineteen theme and the pre-filled templates do not look as good when used with other themes.</p>\n<p>The functionality included in the Full Site Editing plugin may also be coming to Jetpack. Automattic&#8217;s developers are currently <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/32490\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">researching the best way to include it</a>, since so far it has been developed as a separate plugin and not geared towards becoming a Jetpack module.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-site-editing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Site Editing</a> is not recommended for use in production, as it&#8217;s still under active development. The plugin&#8217;s details explicitly state that it is &#8220;only designed to work on the WordPress.com environment and could break after an update.&#8221; Check it out if you want to explore some exciting new possibilities for how the block editor can work together with themes to make page creation more approachable for users. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2019 22:17:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: Pantheon Acquires Visual Regression Testing Platform StagingPilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/pantheon-acquires-visual-regression-testing-platform-stagingpilot\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2952:\"<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io\">Panethon</a>, a managed host geared towards Drupal and WordPress sites, <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/blog/robots-autopilot-and-holy-grail-webops\">has acquired</a> <a href=\"https://stagingpilot.com/\">StagingPilot</a>. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Nathan Tyler, founder of StagingPilot, and his brother Phil Tyler will be brought into the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot is a four year old company that runs a barrage of visual regression tests on WordPress sites before they&#8217;re automatically updated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot creates a copy of the site and places it into a staging environment. The service then conducts a number of tests that include, checking for visual errors, a white screen of death, and elements on a page disappearing. A number of snapshots are created along with a detailed report on the errors that are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josh Koenig, Co-Founder and Head of Product at Pantheon, says the acquisition puts the company within reach of the &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of WebOps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once you have a hundred sites (or heck, even twenty), the grind of keeping up with routine updates can be daunting,&#8221; Koenig said. &#8220;Our existing WebOps tools let our customers automate a lot of that maintenance, but building and managing that automation is on them. We want our users to automate their operations, not operate their automation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantheon plans to integrate StagingPilot into its offerings in three phases. First, it will migrate StagingPilot&#8217;s technology into its existing managed updates feature and extend it beyond WordPress to support Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the company plans to fully integrate the service with its organizational features providing substantial benefits to agency partners or those who manage many sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third phase looks to take advantage of services such as Google&#8217;s applied learning machines to create AI-driven testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out-of-the box, WordPress only updates minor versions automatically and leaves major updates, plugins, and themes up to the user. One of the most common fears of enabling auto-updates is having something on the site break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, the process of testing updates is left up to the consultant or whoever manages the site. Depending on the size or number of sites being managed, it can become a major time suck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting companies like Pantheon with StagingPilot, <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/products/managed-wordpress/\">LiquidWeb</a>, and others are easing the fear of auto updates in general and saving people a lot of time by using automatic visual regression testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about StagingPilot and to see Nathan demo the service in-person, check out this <a href=\"https://www.wpwatercooler.com/video/stagingpilot-w-nathan-tyler-wpshowandtell/\">episode of WPshowandtell</a> hosted by Jason Tucker. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2019 01:32:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 5.8 Released with Prototype of New Block-based Widgets Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-8-released-with-prototype-of-new-block-based-widgets-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3753:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 5.8</a> was released today with three new features and more than three dozen enhancements, documentation improvements, and bug fixes. </p>\n<p>This release gives users the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15625\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">change the text color in the Heading block</a>. The same color options available in the paragraph and button blocks are now available in the heading block.</p>\n<p>A recent release of the EditorsKit plugin (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-in-editorskit-1-5-justify-text-alignment-autosave-on-off-toggle-and-highlighted-text\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.5</a>) added this feature and the plugin&#8217;s author had tracked nearly two dozen issues and discussions where users have asked for text highlighting or similar features. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We really need this for all block controls (lists, paragraphs etc),&#8221; Ben Gillbanks <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15625#issuecomment-495940882\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the relevant GitHub issue. &#8220;Anything that can be used on a group block with a colored background could cause readability issues and so the text color will need to be changeable.&#8221; Gutenberg designer Mark Uraine said that adding text color options to all the text blocks is the next step following this update.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.8 adds <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14768\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support for reordering gallery images</a> using a simple arrow control to move selections forwards or backwards. This isn&#8217;t an ideal interaction but Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella said the team is exploring adding drag and drop support.</p>\n<p>Benguella shared a video that demonstrates these two new features:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This release introduces an initial version of the new widgets screen. You can check it out in the admin under the <strong>Gutenberg &raquo; Widgets (beta)</strong> menu. It&#8217;s currently just a proof of concept and has quite a few bugs but gives a preview of how the the widget management screen is shaping up. Benguella said users can currently edit/update widget areas using any available block. The proof of concept implementation in the plugin allows the team to continue polishing the UI and fix bugs in future releases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-4.11.47-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor is also making progress on mobile, adding quotes and video to the available blocks, rich captions for the image block, and fixes for several critical bugs. </p>\n<p>The editor has also recaptured some of its performance gains that were lost in version 5.7, according to recent performance benchmarks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-1.17.19-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had some commenters on previous posts who said they are confused about the difference between WordPress&#8217; core editor and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin</a>.

We recommend double-checking these factors when a website is launched or significantly redesigned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there is no separate &#8220;mobile-first index.&#8221; Google still references a unified index for serving search results. The difference is in whether a page is crawled by a desktop or mobile user-agent.</p>\n<p>Prior to responsive web design becoming the industry standard, having a separate mobile site was a common practice. Google is actively discouraging this approach now (although still supporting it), as it often causes confusion for users and search engines alike.</p>\n<p>WordPress sites using a responsive theme shouldn&#8217;t have any issues with mobile indexing as long as they are not farming out their mobile sites to a separate domain. A responsive theme is usually enough to make a site compatible with this method of crawling.</p>\n<p>Website owners can check to see how their sites are being crawled by clicking on the &#8220;URL Inspection&#8221; tab inside the Google Search Console. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-28-at-9.37.57-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Webmasters of older sites will <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-floods-webmasters-with-mobile-first-indexing-enabled-notifications-305712\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">get a notification</a> from the Search Console when their sites are moved over to mobile-first indexing. </p>\n<p>After successfully ramping up mobile-first indexing from a small-scale experiment a few years ago, making it the default for new domains should be a good test for evaluating how aggressively it can be rolled out in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2839\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:170:\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10666:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052819-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t have made it through some of the hardest times in my life without WordPress.\" /><p>I grew up in the 90s and 2000s which was a weird time for technology. Part of me remembers carrying around a case of cassette tapes and the sound of dial-up occasionally screaming from the living room. The other half recalls hacking into my dad’s email from the shared family computer for the first time when I was ten. His passwords were never very hard to guess.</p>\n<p>In 2004 or 2005, I started taking more of an interest in the Internet. I wanted to start a blog maybe, but I wasn’t sure what a blog even was. WordPress was one of the first things I stumbled on, but it was still an infant compared to what it’s evolved into and I had no idea how it worked. Was WordPress a blogging website? Was it a thing I could build my own site with? How did it work?</p>\n<p>I just wanted somewhere to be myself online and WordPress intimidated me. So I dabbled, but I didn’t stay. Myspace and Tumblr would teach me to use HTML, because after all, I just wanted my own place to write online.</p>\n<h3>Finding My Way Back to WordPress</h3>\n<p>Eventually, my writing career led me back to WordPress. I was in college, studying English Literature when the opportunity for a Marketing Internship opened up. Around 2011, Chartwells Higher Education, a food service company for college campuses, had launched a huge multi-site network of university dining websites.</p>\n<p>Their largest initiative that year was to drive website traffic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mine was to keep the students from kicking us off campus because of how much everyone hated Campus Dining.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I started a blog.</p>\n<p>“The Inside Scoop” gave students the perspective of a student who works for campus dining. Both goals were met and I fell in love with the idea of using writing to address business problems. Even more exciting, I finally understood WordPress. Although by then, nearly ten years had passed and WordPress had completely changed.</p>\n<h3>Life Changed (a LOT), but WordPress Was Always There</h3>\n<p>At the same time throughout college, I went through a major transition from life as an extremely active athlete to someone with mobility problems. I broke my back, went through everything you can think of to fix it, and ended up with a permanent disability.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I knew by then how to work on a computer in an environment that didn’t necessarily require me to be in an office. It took a few years of adjustment, but eventually, I ended up working for a WordPress-based marketing agency remotely from an RV, which I took anywhere I felt like going.</p>\n<p>For a few years, I became a professional tourist.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’d wake up, get some work done, then adventure all day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By the time I was done, I could tour any city in a single day and still keep up with content writing. But writing content was all I did. Naturally, I still wanted my own website to write on, but all I had was Tumblr. How to actually set up a WordPress site from start to finish was a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>My partner at the agency was supposed to build the site for me, but it never happened. By the time my RV broke down in Rhode Island, 3,500 miles from my hometown, I had lost my chance to build a true travel blog and #vanlife became way too much of a fad to interest me anymore.</p>\n<h3>Learning to Build Websites with WordPress</h3>\n<p>My next step was to build my own website. I probably owe a lot of my “self-taught” skills to websites like WP Beginner and WPCrafter, but I really can’t remember how I learned other than trying and failing many times.</p>\n<p>After a few YouTube videos, I dove in and built the worst website that you could possibly imagine. It was atrocious, but I liked it enough, so I started writing on TaylorElizabethRose.com and building more websites.</p>\n<h3>Returning to a Burning California</h3>\n<p>My next few years were spent spinning my wheels on the East Coast and essentially failing at everything I tried. So I made a plan to move back to California and start my own WordPress-based business. By then I had learned a lot about website management, or so I thought.</p>\n<p>The first version of <a href=\"http://TaylordInk.com\">TaylordInk.com</a> was launched in May of 2017 before I made the trip back to California in September.</p>\n<p>As we drove into Napa Valley, I noticed how dry it looked and said,“This is a fire hazard.” There were no fire breaks and I had seen what the terrain looks like before it burns when my house burned in San Diego in 2007. Napa and Santa Rosa were primed for flames.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But, how many times in one person’s life can their house burn down?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was less than two weeks later when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire\">the Tubbs Fire</a> came through and burned my entire future. The man I’d been with for two years ended up abandoning me. My business equipment was gone. Any professional clothes I may have had were incinerated. All I had were my dogs and my 2013 MacBook Pro, which happened to be with me at the time.</p>\n<h3>Nothing but a Laptop</h3>\n<p>Between October and December 2017, I couldn’t tell you much about what I did or what happened except that I ended up back in my hometown: San Diego. It was a blur of loneliness, depression, and complete failure. Finally, sometime mid-December, I logged into my personal website.</p>\n<p>May as well start with my own identity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was hacked… and gone. I failed to update while I was swimming in my own sorrow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily, my friend from my agency days actually had a backup of the original site. So I salvaged the posts from his files and started rebuilding. I really didn’t get very far until much later in 2019. I just kept designing and redesigning the same pages over and over again.</p>\n<p>On the second or third time I logged in after the fire, I saw the WordCamp San Diego information on the Dashboard and bought a ticket before I could change my mind about going.</p>\n<h3>Discovering the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordCamp San Diego didn’t happen until months later, but it was the next time I really did anything productive in my life. It was kind of my last-ditch attempt to start a WordPress business or any business at all.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know who I would meet, or how (or if) I would fit in. I certainly never expected to find a community with open arms.</p>\n<p>A weight was lifted from my shoulders almost immediately. Where had all these nerds been my whole life? These were my people!</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a comfort that comes from fitting into a community and finding your people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Being in the company of like-minded people makes the future less bleak. I had hope again for the first time since the fire stole that from me.</p>\n<p>At some point during that WordCamp, a girl named Sochi found out that I was a content writer. She dragged me by the hand to meet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc?s=17\">Matt Cromwell</a> at the Give booth. It was extremely intimidating because the entire Give Team was sitting there staring at me. I didn’t know it then, but I was meeting my own future coworkers.</p>\n<p>Give was hiring a content writer! In fact, they were close to hiring someone else, but I was intrigued. So I inquired the next day and disrupted Matt’s hiring process a bit.</p>\n<p>The next week, I joined Team Give.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, I spoke at 4 WordCamps and attended 6 or 7 total.</p>\n<p>Working at Impress.org and participating in WordCamps has been incredible and I’ve learned more about WordPress over the past year than in all the years before. I don’t think I would have succeeded as well with my own WordPress-based marketing agency without the community.</p>\n<p>More importantly, I wouldn’t have made it through some of the hardest times in my life without WordPress. It was there when I needed to work remotely and it was there when I needed a helping hand to lift me back out of tragedy.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20Grew%20Up%20With%20WordPress%2C%20Then%20WordPress%20Saved%20Me&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me%2F&title=I+Grew+Up+With+WordPress%2C+Then+WordPress+Saved+Me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052819-min-150x150.jpg&description=I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/\" title=\"I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/\">I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:00:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Taylor Rose\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WPTavern: Happy Sweet 16, WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wptavern.com/happy-sweet-16-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8623:\"<p>Over the weekend, the WordPress community celebrated 16 years since Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little forked the B2/cafelog blogging platform to create the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first official release of WordPress</a> on May 27, 2003.

Mullenweg shared his journey in a &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; style throughout the process of selecting the best route for templating and other decisions that laid the groundwork for the first release. Since those early days, WordPress has outpaced all its early competitors to become the most popular CMS by a wide margin. </p>\n<p>Sixteen years later, the software is available in more than 200 languages and is now used by <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33.9%</a> of the top ten million websites. WordPress&#8217; uncommon growth can be attributed to its unique combination of leadership, stability, and a community of thousands of contributors and entrepreneurs that are empowered by its open source licensing. </p>\n<p>Many WordPress product businesses, part of a commercial ecosystem that Mullenweg estimates at $10 billion/year, hosted sales, giveaways, and promotions in honor of the anniversary.

This plugin enables users to migrate specific content from one site to another without the need to update target URLs for media files. This version fixes a couple of UI related bugs and interactions with Gutenberg.</p>\n<h2>CannaBiz 2.4 Released</h2>\n<p>Robert DeVore <a href=\"https://www.wpdispensary.com/cannabiz-v2-4-release-notes/\">has released</a> CannaBiz 2.4, a WordPress theme that&#8217;s specifically tailored for the Cannabis industry.

Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t a good one.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When somebody comes to your project with a well-thought-out, unit-tested fix, and is met by radio silence? The chances are high that they will never come back again. I have submitted WordPress patches in the past, but after this experience I don’t know if I will bother submitting them again. That’s a big change in my perspective on how the WordPress team works, and on how it should work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jalkut isn&#8217;t the first nor will he be the last to have an experience like this. WordPress is a large project that encompasses many areas and if a particular ticket is not in line with higher priorities, the chances of it slipping through the cracks are pretty high.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Launches A New Product but Some People Have No Idea What It Is</h2>\n<p>Human Made has <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/2019/05/21/beyond-wordpress-10-year-evolution-human-made/\">launched a new product</a> called <a href=\"http://altis-dxp.com/\">Altis</a> which is a DXP or Digital Experience Platform for WordPress.

However, this also raises concerns about how sponsor expectations may influence a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can now sponsor developers as a seamless part of your familiar workflow,&#8221; GitHub open source project manager Devon Zuegel said in the announcement. &#8220;When a contributor answers your question, triages your issue, or merges your code, you can head to their profile—or simply hover over their username—to sponsor their work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/native-workflow-white.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Sponsorship is a somewhat subjective term and GitHub isn&#8217;t defining what it means here in the context of marrying it to a contributor&#8217;s workflow. For some, it may mean a no-strings-attached donation. For others, the idea of sponsorship always comes the expectation of a return on an investment. </p>\n<p>Ruby on Rails creator and Basecamp founder David Heinemeier Hansson was one of the most prominent to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1131585498395242496\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">raise concerns about GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors program on Twitter</a>. He sees it as &#8220;a grave risk to open source.&#8221; </p>\n<p>“&#8217;Why haven’t you fixed my issue yet!? I sent you $10! I demand you honor your obligations here. I paid you,&#8217; welcome to small-donation open source 2019,&#8221; Hansson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m sure GitHub had all the right intentions here. And I’m sure this will work out well for a select few developers who will amass enough donations to ignore individual claims to their time. But I think it’s a grave risk to the culture of open source.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hansson referenced a recent keynote he delivered at RailsConf 2019 titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open source beyond the market</a>,&#8221; challenging those whose initial reactions are simply that &#8220;donations are a good thing.&#8221; Bringing the concept of sponsorship a into the workflow introduces a transactional nature to the work, with unavoidable marketplace expectations that can complicate a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The marketplace norms are hard to escape,&#8221; Hansson said in his keynote. &#8220;They seep into our unconsciousness. There are plenty of open source users who think themselves less as a recipient of a gift and more like customers with warranty claims, that they’ve done the makers of said open source software a great honor by merely choosing to use their thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In fact, it’s kind of a natural extension of a society that worships consumerism above little less. A natural extension of &#8216;the customer is always right,&#8217; of the adversarial relationship between buyer and seller.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others have expressed more specific concerns, such as Microsoft&#8217;s GitHub becoming the dominant payment platform for open source developers, sponsors receiving priority consideration in issues and PRs over user and project needs, and developers deliberately introducing bugs in order to solicit donations. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Already seeing “I will prioritise your issues” in the ‘rewards’ sections on the first sponsor-enabled accounts&#8230; so.. you called it</p>\n<p>&mdash; Lasse Rafn (@LasseRafn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LasseRafn/status/1131601620582764555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pia Mancini, co-founder of Open Collective, <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-collective/on-github-sponsors-5450b63caf7d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a response</a> to the concerns that people were sending her way on Twitter. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy to see such an important player in the ecosystem helping out with the problem of sustaining open source,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;Sustaining our commons is an effort that requires everyone to contribute. I am glad to see Github come on board.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This idea of the sustainability of open source and the &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tragedy of the commons</a>&#8221; is one that <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hansson and many others reject</a>, but it is one that is commonly embraced by copyleft advocates. It works for Open Collective&#8217;s business model, but comes with its own flavor of reciprocity. Open Collective is distinct in that its funding service is removed from the direct workflow of software development, instead of deeply integrated like GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors tool. </p>\n<p>Mancini said that her company can &#8220;happily coexist with GitHub Sponsors&#8221; because of Open Collective&#8217;s chief differentiators. It was built for projects, not individuals. It offers full transparency about where funds come from and how they are spent. The company also manages the paperwork and tax forms required for fiscal sponsorship. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Open Collective is for funding projects as opposed to individual maintainers,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;We strongly believe in supporting communities as a whole, as well as the individuals that make up that community. This helps with ensuring more diversity, and less concentration of power and decisions on one maintainer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She also cautioned against GitHub trying to swallow up too many aspects of the open source community and injecting its own corporate interests. She hints at a line that the company has not yet crossed but many are still wary of what Microsoft plans to do with GitHub.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, there’s risk: centralization and lock-in are very risky for communities,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;GitHub is Microsoft, which has its own metrics in mind, and it will be difficult for them to be independent, regardless of the good faith of the folks involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Attempting to own all aspects of the open source community is a harmful strategy. So far, I don’t think GitHub is trying to do this. They are in a position to help, and they are open to collaborating with existing players.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Does it compete with Open Collective? To some extent. But our growth has never been primarily driven by individuals giving to individuals, but by companies giving to projects. GitHub Sponsors does not solve the need sponsor companies have for invoices and a legal entity to engage with for their vendor systems and documentation requirements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s intentions may simply be a recognition of what open source software has matured to become &#8211; a driving force of innovation in all industries and an effort worthy of financial support. Giving developers an easy way to receive some reward for their contributions seems rather innocuous, but the concern is that Microsoft cannot foresee the long term consequences of its sponsorship implementation inside GitHub&#8217;s workflow.

Automattic will begin working on a roadmap for the product after integrating the Prospress team into the company.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/prospress-joins-automattic-to-jointly-develop-woocommerce-subscriptions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement Q&#038;A</a>, Prospress founder Brent Shepherd said he is excited to see how Subscriptions will integrate with Automattic&#8217;s existing products and offered a glimpse at what they may be working on in the near future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In more specific terms, that could mean looking at closer relationships with how payments are handled, or integrations with other platforms such as WordPress.com. There are also a couple of things to solve both in WooCommerce and subscriptions to help them scale better. Interestingly, these challenges are almost identical for the two codebases. By working more closely to solve them than we ever could apart, I hope we can do a better job of implementing solutions and in a shorter time frame.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce Subscriptions can already be purchased a la carte and used on WordPress.com stores, so nothing will change in this department. I asked Paul Maiorana, head of partnerships for WooCommerce, if there are any plans to integrate Subscription functionality with Jetpack sites, as the plugin&#8217;s team is currently pursuing a Membership feature that is essentially recurring payments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re excited to learn from the Prospress team as they’re experts in this space, and could see Memberships potentially leveraging some of the Subscriptions code to avoid duplicating efforts — but we have no plans to integrate the products,&#8221; Maiorana said.</p>\n<p>The Prospress acquisition also includes <a href=\"https://automatewoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AutomateWoo</a>, a marketing automation tool, and <a href=\"https://robotninja.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Robot Ninja</a>, which offers automated checkout testing for WooCommerce stores. <a href=\"https://prospress.com/automatewoo-joins-prospress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prospress acquired AutomateWoo</a> in June 2018 as a complementary product to Subscriptions. There are no immediate changes planned for these products that would affect customers.</p>\n<p>Prospress has been deeply invested in the WooCoommerce open source project for many years. WooCommerce has 834 contributors and Shepherd is currently among the top 10. His company <a href=\"https://prospress.com/five-for-the-future-of-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">committed to the five for the future initiative</a> last year by sponsoring one of its employees to contribute full time to WooCommerce core. For the past five years Shepherd has also co-organized the WooCommerce San Francisco meet-up.</p>\n<p>Cornering the market on Subscriptions and being able to ensure a tight integration for customers gives WooCommerce a more competitive edge in the broader e-commerce space. Prospress&#8217; smaller products are also strategic additions to WooCommerce&#8217;s offerings. If Automattic can integrate the marketing automation and automated checkout testing tools in one hosted package, these tools have the potential to greatly increase customer&#8217;s success and confidence in their WooCommerce powered stores.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2019 23:20:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Take the 2019 WP&amp;UP Mental Health and Well-Being Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90124\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/take-the-2019-wpup-mental-health-and-well-being-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:652:\"<p><a href=\"https://wpandup.org/\">WP&amp;UP</a> is a mental health and well-being charitable organization founded by Dan Maby in 2018, whose mission is to promote positive mental health throughout the WordPress ecosystem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization is currently <a href=\"https://wpandup.org/survey-2019.html\">hosting a survey</a> to better understand the needs of the community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The questions cover the general work environment, general mental health and well-being, and specific work-related mental health and well-being.

It has long been the highest revenue extension in the WooCommerce marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Maiorana, WooCommerce&#8217;s Head of Payments, Shipping, and Partnerships, tells me, <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">&#8220;Subscriptions is an important differentiator for WooCommerce amongst eCommerce platforms, and we’re really excited to now be working closely with the Prospress team to create a more unified experience.&#8221;</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have known Brent and his team for a long time, and I&#8217;ve used Subscriptions for many years. It&#8217;s an outstanding and complex project that requires enormous amounts of testing, a skilled development team, and a lot of care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/notes/woocommerce-offering-20-higher-rates-trade-third-party-developers-offering-support/\">support structure changed</a> for third-party WooCommerce extensions, which led to an immediate surge of support hiring by the largest extension providers — namely Prospress and SkyVerge — for whom, for the purpose of disclosure, I do contract work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support is the biggest component of a plugin company, especially for a complex one like Subscriptions, which interfaces (sometimes in very different ways) with dozens of payment processors. I have seen spec documentation for their proposed new features, and it is astounding how much detail is required to be outlaid before a single line of code is changed or written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Automattic, a company that formerly consisted of a few dozen folks now has the backing of hundreds of &#8220;Happiness Engineers&#8221; to help manage the load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary risk I see for Subscriptions with Automattic is that it will get lost in the fray if Prospress developers are pulled to other work and more pressing needs. I have perceived this to be the case with their ownership of WP Job Manager, WooCommerce Bookings, and some other extensions — though none with the significance of Subscriptions. I think the strategic importance of Subscriptions <em>should</em> keep that at bay under good management, and I know Automattic management understands that strategic importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic will eventually go public, I&#8217;m almost certain. Strategically, I fully believe the Prospress acquisition is the right move for them. If I were involved, I would&#8217;ve been trying to make this acquisition for years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having significant revenue streams under the scope of a company out of your control is a risk, to my thinking as a theoretical investor. I would take this now in-house feature set direct to marketing channels against Shopify  <br />— which is an absolute juggernaut in the eCommerce space today, particularly among high revenue generating stores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what led Brent to make the choice to join Automattic now, but it&#8217;s a much-deserved exit after something like eight years of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brent said the following <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/prospress-joins-automattic-to-jointly-develop-woocommerce-subscriptions/\">in the announcement Q&amp;A</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I’m extremely proud of what we’ve achieved at Prospress. I’ve had the great pleasure of having some amazing people join me over the years. Together I believe we’ve advanced a mission that matters to me — so much so that it predated Prospress and even WooCommerce.</p><p>I believe joining Automattic is the best next stage for Prospress, and I am personally excited to lead the transition and work with the Automattic team to further WooCommerce.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy for Brent and the entire Prospress team. I hope they made a fortune with this acquisition; in my mind, Subscriptions is one of the key reasons for WooCommerce&#8217;s amazing growth as a platform. I think they will do great there, and I have no doubt they will stay committed to making Subscriptions continue as a terrific tool in the toolbox that is WooCommerce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2019 19:31:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Google Updates Mobile Search Results to Include Website Branding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90077\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/google-updates-mobile-search-results-to-include-website-branding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1999:\"<p>Google is rolling out an <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/new-design-google-search/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update to mobile search results</a> that includes website branding.

After just a few days in the directory, the theme already has more than 10,000 active installations. It is essentially a blank starter theme that offers 100% compatibility with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hello-screenshot.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Page builders with a large user base are in a unique position to influence the WordPress theme market. Loyal users will often select a page builder before choosing a theme from a limited pool of those that boast compatibility with their preferred plugin. Elementor is no exception, with more than 2 million installations and a 4.8-star average rating on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Lately the trend with some of the most popular and intuitive WordPress themes is to offer a strong, niche design out of the box, where users don&#8217;t have to make too many choices or fiddle with settings. Hello takes a different path, opeorating as more of a conduit to the Elementor page template library. </p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s screenshot shows a home page designed in Elementor but the actual theme has very few styles and doesn&#8217;t look like anything out of the box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-1.44.58-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Once installed, the first step is to create a page and select &#8220;Edit in Elementor.&#8221; From there users can select from a library of different landing page templates or start building their own layouts from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-4.50.56-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hello is not a new theme. Elementor first released it on GitHub in March 2018. Hosting it on WordPress.org allows users to more easily install it and get automatic updates for improvements and security fixes. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin repository played a huge role in Elementor’s exceptional growth, and we hold similar high hopes for the Hello theme,&#8221; Elementor CMO Ben Pines said.</p>\n<p>There are a few major drawbacks to using the Hello theme that may hinder its potential growth. Access to headers, footers, and widgets is restricted to Elementor Pro users. This seems like a confusing way to build a WordPress site and might be a useful detail to include in the theme&#8217;s description on WordPress.org. If there&#8217;s another way to access headers and footers without purchasing Elementor Pro, I wasn&#8217;t able to find it.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce store owners should be aware that the Hello theme does not yet offer comprehensive support for WooCommerce page styles. Although the release post advertises the theme as having &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; compatibility with WooCommerce, the store pages are bare bones and not very attractive. One user commented that the checkout and cart pages do not look very inviting and asked if it will be possible to edit fonts and colors with Elementor. </p>\n<p>Elementor representative Matan Naveh responded to multiple concerns about WooCommerce support and said that full compatibility is still in development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WooCommerce is a highly complex plugin and any pages that rely on its basic elements (e.g. Cart, My Account, Checkout, etc.) are even more so. The level of complexity is such that changes in something as routine as a WooCommerce update could cause havoc on a layout, resulting in a devastating effect on the webpage’s functionality.</p>\n<p>Currently, Elementor enables you to customize the areas surrounding the WooCommerce elements. Take the cart page, for example – You may not be able to customize the table itself, but you can customize the title or the area where the table is located. You can also insert your own images, backgrounds, and content according to your needs (e.g. adding an FAQ).</p>\n<p>We are considering several options for achieving full compatibility with WooCommerce. But this is still in its development stages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some users who switched from the Astra theme, another one commonly used by Elementor users, have <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/introducing-hello-theme/#comment-27019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/introducing-hello-theme/#comment-27035\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">significant (50%) decreases</a> in loading time on real world sites after switching to the Hello theme. Elementor claims that it is &#8220;the fastest WordPress theme ever created,&#8221; but the comparison benchmarks posted don&#8217;t include any themes that are known for high performance. </p>\n<p>Elementor is working on creating a child theme for Hello. It is currently in development on <a href=\"https://github.com/elementor/hello-theme-child\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and the team is working on getting it approved for WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The primary purpose of the Hello theme is to offer compatibility with the page builder, but it is not recommended for users who are not using Elementor. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2019 02:10:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 353 – Slack of Boundaries and A Walk to WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90052&preview=true&preview_id=90052\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-353-slack-of-boundaries-and-a-walk-to-wceu\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2125:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss an article published by Vox on how Slack is not improving productivity, especially in large team environments.

In November 2003, a few months after I discovered WordPress, I gave it a spin on my personal blog. A few months later, I started contributing in the form of translating WordPress core and documentation into Japanese.</p>\n<p>Today, I make a living as a project and community manager in the field of translation &amp; localization. I get to help people all over the world publish their voice online using their own language, while raising two kids in Tokyo, Japan. This is all thanks to WordPress, which showed me the brand new world of open source I never knew existed, and those who had given me the opportunity to participate in it.</p>\n<p>Let me share my story about how WordPress has changed my life.</p>\n<img />WordCamp Tokyo 2018 organizing team &amp; volunteer staff\n<h3>Discovering WordPress</h3>\n<p>I first found WordPress in the summer of 2003. At that time, with a degree in graphic design at a state university in the Midwest, I was working in a field that had nothing to do with design or web. The small web marketing company I joined after graduation couldn’t make it through the dot com bubble. When I moved back to the U.S. with my then-husband for him to go back to graduate school in Detroit, I couldn’t re-enter the field because of my lack of experience. I settled with a temp in-house translator/admin assistant position at an automotive company to financially support the household. You could say it was a practical choice. Or, to put it frankly, I just gave up and went with the demand for the clerical job with Japanese skill.</p>\n<p>The good thing that came out of it was that I had plenty of time after work. My ex-husband had to study all day, and my temp job was precisely 9-5. Every night, we rarely watched T.V. or went out but headed for our computers. I worked on my own website and sometimes friend’s site for a fee, using just HTML and a little bit of CSS. Back then, reading blogs written by web designers was the best way to follow up-to-date news and techniques of frontend development.</p>\n<p>Inspired by those blogs in both English and Japanese, I decided to start mine. I published my first post on a Movable Type blog in April 2003. I wrote almost every day for a few months. Then as I was getting frustrated with some aspects of Movable Type, I tried several blog engines including WordPress.</p>\n<p>With WordPress, the process of customizing blog design through edits to PHP files was straightforward and enjoyable, so I got addicted to working with WordPress right away. I almost had no experience beyond HTML and CSS before then, but I was surprised that I was able to create a dynamic site myself.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/naoko-blog-design.png\"><img /></a>My blog design between 2003-2019\n<h3>Translating WordPress</h3>\n<p>In November 2003, I re-launched my blog using WordPress. In December, I learned that there was a person named Otsukare who made a Japanese version of WordPress. This fork of WordPress, called “WordPress ME (Multilingual Edition)”, had the first comprehensive WordPress resource site in Japanese, with documentation Wiki and phpBB forums. Through the forum, I started helping him with translating documentation from English to Japanese.</p>\n<p>WordPress stayed as a relatively minor blog tool/CMS in Japan for years, but that didn’t change the fact that it was a piece of software that I really enjoyed using. I kept <a href=\"http://wpdocs.osdn.jp/\">translating Codex</a>, participated in <a href=\"https://naoko.blog/tag/theme-competition/\">theme competitions</a>, and helping others on the forums. It was the first time for me to experience being part of an open source community and working together with people I’ve never met in person (and without being paid!).</p>\n<p>What kept me going was the feeling that I’m part of something bigger. I loved using WordPress, and it was exciting that I could help spread the word. WordPress community gave me a chance to work with people around the world — years before “remote work” was a universally recognized word. There were no free voice/video chat applications, no Slack, but the interpersonal connections have grown deeper because everyone in the community was centered around a tool to deliver your voices to others far from reach.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WordPress Polyglots at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> contributor day, translating to so many languages!

I vaguely remember my question &#8211; something like “I love WordPress, and I want to help spread it more in Japan. What should I do?” But I still clearly remember his answer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You should do a WordCamp.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although it probably was just a casual suggestion since we happened to be at a WordCamp, that idea stayed with me. That short interaction was no doubt the initial trigger of our first WordCamp in Japan, a year later. I was living in the U.S., but that really didn’t matter. Japanese WordPress translators, developers, and users who knew each other through the forums and blogs all worked together to run <a href=\"https://ja.wordpress.org/2008/09/04/wordcamp-tokyo-2008/\">WordCamp Tokyo 2008</a>.</p>\n<img />WordCamp Tokyo 2008. Photo credit: Odyssey\n<h3>Career and Leadership</h3>\n<p>My career also changed dramatically between 2006 and 2009.</p>\n<p>Because I gained general blog template customization skills through working with WordPress, freelance work started to come in. I also had the opportunity to write WordPress books in Japanese. Thanks to WordPress, I was able to learn and practice the idea of ​​Web Standards. My ability to write solid markups was valued, and I got my first full-time technical job as a frontend engineer at an ad agency in a suburb of Detroit.</p>\n<p>In April 2009, I started as a part-time Happiness Engineer (customer support for WordPress.com) at Automattic, then in 2010 offered a full-time position. Since then, my role had evolved into the field of localization, and I’m happy to tell you that my 10th anniversary is coming up soon.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, I’ve taken up some more global responsibilities within the WordPress community, such as one of the Global Mentors for the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots Team</a>, and lead organizer of <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day 4</a>. Most recently, I was selected as the global leader of the first WordCamp Asia (planned for 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand).</p>\n<h3>Growing and Giving Back</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community taught me so much.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep making efforts in good faith and results will follow.</li>\n<li>It takes time to build trust.</li>\n<li>Everyone has the potential to grow.</li>\n<li>You can’t ignore diversity so might as well embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes the process of gaining such new insights was painful, but I still feel I’m lucky to have been given challenges that made me grow.</p>\n<p>To give back, I want to continue helping communities outside of the English speaking world. I believe that’s the most powerful thing I can do to remove the barriers on the web and the vast world that it touches.</p>\n<a

を通して成長できたという話</h2>\n<p>高野直子</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WordPress のことを知ったのは、約16年前でした。</p>\n<p>その数カ月後には元持っていたブログを WordPress に切り替え、さらにまた数カ月後には現在も続いている WordPress への翻訳という形での貢献を始めることになりました。振り返ると、社会人になってからほとんどの年数を、WordPress とともに過ごしてきたわけです。</p>\n<p>私が現在東京で子育てをしながらグローバルかつ柔軟な環境で働くことができるのは、新しい世界を見せてくれ、機会を与えてくれた WordPress の存在のおかげです。</p>\n<p>今こうやって、「WordPress との関わりが自分と周りの『バリア』を破ったこと」というテーマで記事を書かせてもらうにあたって思いを巡らせてみると、本当にこのソフトウェアと出会わなければまったく違う人生を歩んでいただろうなと思います。多くの人たちにもめぐりあうことはなかっただろうし、仕事はもちろん、住んでもいる場所も違っていたかもしれない。</p>\n<p>そんな、私にとってとても大きな存在の WordPress が、迷える20代を過ごしていた自分をどんなふうに変えてくれたかのお話をしようと思います。</p>\n<h3>WordPress との出会い</h3>\n<p>私が WordPress を知ったのは、2003年の春か夏頃でした。その頃の私はというと、高校留学後にアメリカ中西部の地方大学でグラフィックデザインの学位を取ったものの、新卒で入った小さな会社がドットコムバブルで立ち行かなくなったり、当時の夫の大学院入学のためにアメリカに戻ってきても経験不足で Web 関係の仕事には就けなかったり。とは言え家計を支える立場を選んだわけで、一旦やりたかった仕事はあきらめて、日系自動車会社で派遣をやっていた日々でした。インハウス翻訳者兼事務補助職のような感じで、お給料と需要を優先して良く言えばがむしゃらにがんばっていたし、悪くいうと目の前のことでいっぱいいっぱいという状況。</p>\n<p>ただ、そのころ時間だけはたっぷりあったんです。夫は暇さえあれば勉強していたし、派遣の仕事もそんなに忙しいものではなかったので、定時に帰って夕食後はテレビを見たり出かけたりはせず、それぞれパソコンに向かっていました。</p>\n<p>趣味やフリーランスの制作者として細々と HTML 手打ちのサイトなんかも作っていたのですが、Web デザイナーが個人で発信する情報はその当時ブログを読むのが何より最新で、ワクワクするものでした。</p>\n<p>そこからいきなり WordPress をインストールしたわけではなくて、まずは一番簡単そうだった Blogger.com を触ってみて制限がちょっと多すぎると感じ、Movable Type をしばらく運用してあまり相性がよくないかもと感じた、というのが私のブログ作りのスタートでした。その後ぴったりなタイミングで b2 からフォークしたリリース版を出したばかりだった WordPress に出会いました。</p>\n<p>PHP のファイルを触りながら自分のブログを作っていく過程が本当に楽しくて、いつのまにか WordPress にハマっていました。そのころはシンプルな構成だったからというのはもちろんあるんですが、それまでほぼ HTML と CSS しか書いたことがなかった自分がいつのまにかそんなふうにいわゆる「動的」サイトを作れるようになっていくことに自分でも驚きました。</p>\n<h3>WordPress 翻訳を始める</h3>\n<p>2003年11月にブログエンジンの変更を完了したサイトを公開し、12月に日本語版の WordPress フォーク “WordPress ME (Multilingual Edition)” を公開しているサイトがあることを知りました。Otsukare さんというエンジニアが行なっていた日本語情報の発信や日本語フォーラムでの回答をお手伝いしているうち、1ユーザーからファンへ、そしてローカリゼーションという分野でのコントリビュートをするようになっていきました。</p>\n<p>それから何年も、WordPress は日本では比較的マイナーなブログツール/CMS ではあったんですが、自分の中では本当に大好きなソフトウェアで、地道に <a href=\"http://wpdocs.osdn.jp/\">Codex</a> の翻訳をしたり、<a href=\"https://naoko.blog/tag/theme-competition/\">テーマ作成コンテスト</a>に応募したり、フォーラムで回答したりしていました。オープンソースという世界も、会ったこともない人たちと（お金にならない！）作業を一緒にするのも初めてでしたが、WordPress を通して会う人たちは本当に様々で、固定観念を覆してくれた気がします。留学や在米で「世界」を分かった気になっていたけど、それよりも私にとって理解を深めてくれたのは、英語を使ってアクセスすることができるようになった、多様な価値観が存在するオンラインのコミュニティでした。</p>\n<p>自分がブログを書くことが好きで、そのツールの成長に少しでも関われるという喜びが、飽きずにオープンソース活動を続けられた理由だった気がします。まだ「リモートワーク」なんて言葉も、動画チャットツールや Slack さえもない時期からオンラインで世界中の人達とコラボレーションする文化を持つ WordPress でしたが、遠く離れた人に考えを届られるブログというツールが中心にあったからこそ、コミュニティは深みを持って成長してきたし、人と人のつながりが構築されていったのだと思います。</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Tokyo の運営</h3>\n<p>2007年、サンフランシスコで開かれた WordCamp に遠征し、マットに声をかけました。「WordPress が好きで、日本でももっと広めるために何かできないかなと思ってるけど、どうしたらいいかな？」そんな内容だったと思います。質問の記憶はおぼろげですが、彼の答えは今でも覚えています。</p>\n<blockquote><p>「WordCamp やったらいいよ！（You should do a WordCamp.）」</p></blockquote>\n<p>たまたま WordCamp にいたからの思いつきから出た言葉だったのかもしれませんが、そのときの一言が印象的で、約1年後に日本初の WordCamp を実行するきっかけになったのは間違いありません。私自身は日本に住んでいなかったにも関わらず <a href=\"https://ja.wordpress.org/2008/09/04/wordcamp-tokyo-2008/\">WordCamp Tokyo 2008</a> が実行できたのは、単なる言い出しっぺの私に「いいね！」と言って一緒に運営をしてくれた他の翻訳者、開発者、日本語版ユーザーの方々とのつながりがあったからでした。</p>\n<h3>キャリアへの影響</h3>\n<p>2006年～2009年には、自分のキャリアも大きく変わりました。</p>\n<p>WordPress にハマることで身につけたブログテンプレート一般のカスタマイズ能力でフリーランスの仕事が入ってきたり、WordPress の本を日本語で書く機会もいただきました。Web 標準の考え方に触れて実践することができたのも WordPress のおかげで、「普通に、きちんとマークアップが書ける」スキルを評価されて、ずっと前から入社したかったデトロイト郊外の会社でフロントエンドエンジニアとしての経験を積むこともできました。その後、2009年にお声がけをいただき、Automattic でのカスタマーサポート職としてスタートして、2010年からフルタイムでこの会社の「社員」となり、現在はローカリゼーション関連のチームでプロジェクト管理を担当しています。もうすぐ勤務10年を迎えます。</p>\n<p>回り回って今は<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">翻訳チーム</a>のグローバルメンターや、<a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> 4のリードオーガナイザーを任せてもらったり、そして自分でも驚くことに第一回 WordCamp Asia（2020年、バンコクにて開催予定）のグローバルリードにも選んでいただきました。</p>\n<h3>学びとお返し</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>誠実に努力を積み重ねていくことが実を結ぶ。</li>\n<li>信頼を築くには時間がかかる。</li>\n<li>誰にでも大きく成長できる可能性がある。</li>\n<li>多様性は必然。容認してしまうしかない。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>こういうことは当たり前のようでいて、実感できないような環境も少なくないのではないでしょうか。WordPress コミュニティだって常にパーフェクトではもちろんないにしろ、この場所ではそんな「当たり前」が大事されている、と私はよく感じます。みんなが納得できる普遍的な正しさが、長期的な視点での深みのあるコミュニティの維持と成長に欠かせない要素だと理解している人が多いからなのかなと思っています。</p>\n<p>自信も経験も少なかった自分にたくさんのことを学ばせてくれた WordPress と、その周りにいる人たちへの恩返しも込めて、これからさらに英語圏以外のコミュニティも手助けしていければと思っています。そうすることで、Web と世界を少しでも良い場所にできると信じているし、関わる多くの人のバリアを取り除くきっかけとなるはずです。</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right

libraries are one of the few remaining community centers where people freely pass on valuable skills to neighbors young and old. In addition to offering free access to books, computers, and the internet, libraries often host educational classes as a public service, with an emphasis on teaching fundamental skills for navigating the digital world. </p>\n<p>Many people who are on fixed incomes or living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to have internet service at home. For them, the library is a gateway to online communication, job hunting, and learning new skills.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, using WordPress has become one of those important skills, as the software is now used by 33% of the top 10 million websites, across nearly every major industry. </p>\n<p>Packed into a full schedule of toddler story time, book chats, and knitting groups, the public library in Loveland, Colorado, is hosting a free workshop called <a href=\"https://lovelandpubliclibrary.org/event/wordpress-websites-t2-19/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started with a WordPress Website</a> on May 22, 2019, from 9:00 AM – 10:30 AM MDT. Participants will learn the history and terminology of WordPress, along with the step-by-step basics of creating a website. Topics include posts vs pages, using media, installing a theme, and using plugins. </p>\n<p>Participants who cannot attend in person at the library can register online for a free ticket on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/353235661970837/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or through <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wordpress-websites-t2-19-tickets-59360407577?aff=efbeventtix&fbclid=IwAR18MOc21IlInUmdK3JRXPdXDMT8FPMkE4kYw5ltMpTyNsR47kWSWE3CZQY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eventbrite</a>. Those participating remotely will need to install the Adobe Connect meeting browser plugin and will be able to listen to the lecture through the digital classroom and ask questions via chat.</p>\n<p>Another class will be hosted July 2, 2019, for those who are unable to attend the May workshop.</p>\n<p>Loveland Public Library is one of many libraries that host free WordPress classes. Skokie Public Library in Skokie, Illinois, will be hosting a <a href=\"https://skokielibrary.info/events/10377/build-a-website-with-wordpresscom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Build a Website with WordPress.com</a> workshop on Friday, May 24, and the Denver Public Library offers <a href=\"https://www.denverlibrary.org/ctc/wordpress-com-i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">similar courses for WordPress.com</a> in various locations. The New York Public Library plans to offer a <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/events/programs/2019/10/03/blogging-beginners\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blogging for Beginners</a> course at its Woodland Heights location on October 3, 2019. These are just a small sampling of the educational opportunities offered in this format. If you know someone who wants to get started with WordPress, local libraries are a good resource for finding a free, in-person class. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 May 2019 21:56:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6976\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4909:\"<p>WordPress 5.2.1 is now available!

What began as a block visibility management plugin has grown to include more features aimed at tweaking various settings in the editor. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.5</a> adds some text, heading, and paragraph styling and formatting options that aren&#8217;t currently available in core. For example, Gutenberg lets users change the background color and text color for an entire paragraph, but that&#8217;s where the color customizations end. EditorsKit now supports highlighting a section of text or a heading and choosing a color or background color.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This may seem like a niche request to implement but Carandang has <a href=\"https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues/9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tracked</a> nearly two dozen related issues and discussions where users are asking for text highlighting or similar features. </p>\n<p>This release also adds underline and justify alignment options to the paragraph block. Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t include it by default, as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-removes-the-underline-and-justify-buttons-from-the-editor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.7 removed the justify button from the TinyMCE editor</a> in 2016. However, the demand for justified text has not disappeared.</p>\n<p>In adding the format to EditorsKit, Carandang <a href=\"https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues/10#issuecomment-493672412\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cited 10 issues</a> from Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repository and eight WordPress.org support topics where users have asked for the justify text option or have commented on it being missing. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gutenberg-justify-underline-formats.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Those who have Jetpack installed will already have the justify alignment option. Carandang plans to add a check for wpcom/justify to the next release so users of both plugins won&#8217;t have two justify options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EditorsKit 1.5</a> tackles the widespread issues with Gutenberg&#8217;s autosave function by adding a toggle that allows users to enable/disable it. This setting can be found under the vertical ellipses menu at the top of the editor.<br />\nUsers have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9220\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> getting stuck in autosave, particularly with slower connection speeds, and some have experienced problems with their hosts. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Neat. I’ve seen users leave their browser tab open all night and their session expires, but the autosaves continue to post even though it’s now getting a 403. Then when the person wakes up their server blacklisted their IP.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jay (@wpdevlife) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpdevlife/status/1123209118246944768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the result of getting stuck in autosave, users often attempt to refresh the screen only to lose the work. This has been an ongoing problem since last year. EditorsKit gives users the option to turn autosave off if they are experiencing problems and save manually as they see fit.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 adds theme support for changing the block width to match the page template and layout. This allows theme developers to customize block sizes based on the template the users selects.</p>\n<p>Carandang has been adding new features based on his own needs but has found most of them to be fairly common requests in the Gutenberg repository. He made upcoming features and ideas for EditorsKit <a href=\"https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public on GitHub</a> and is accepting feature suggestions in this format. A few of his current ideas under discussion include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a React emoji picker</li>\n<li>copy link icon for the top bar of the editor</li>\n<li>to-do style using checkbox and strike through</li>\n<li>Markdown support for RichText API</li>\n<li>uppercase and indent formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Carandang if he has any plans to add an option for paring down Gutenberg to the bare essentials with an interface more focused on writing. He said it is a possibility but is optimistic that the Gutenberg team may work to solve this common complaint in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, specially when my writer colleague asked me about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think it&#8217;s not time for that yet. I&#8217;ll wait for more Gutenberg releases before deciding if it&#8217;s needed in EditorsKit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carandang said he doesn&#8217;t plan to add any custom blocks to EditorsKit. His goal is to extend blocks for users to have options that they can utilize globally, while using whichever blocks plugin(s) they prefer. The plugin currently has no revenue model but he may pursue monetization in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At of the moment, I&#8217;m more focused on building the plugin features rather than monetization, but extensions may come in a year or two when Gutenberg is more stable,&#8221; Carandang said. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 May 2019 14:58:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: CoBlocks 1.9.5 Merges Block Gallery Plugin into Collection, Adds New Form Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/coblocks-1-9-5-merges-block-gallery-plugin-into-collection-adds-new-form-block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4217:\"<p><a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, a collection of page builder blocks that was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by GoDaddy</a>, has added four new blocks in version 1.9.5. This is the first major release since the plugin was acquired from Rich Tabor and his co-creators. Tabor now heads up a WordPress Experience team at GoDaddy where CoBlocks&#8217; development continues.</p>\n<p>This release merges the three gallery blocks (Masonry, Stacked, and Carousel) from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-gallery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Gallery</a> plugin into CoBlocks. There is a migration path for users to convert their existing Block Gallery blocks to CoBlocks&#8217; gallery blocks. Block Gallery is still available on WordPress.org as a separate plugin with 5,000 active installs, which is actually more installs than CoBlocks (4,000). Tabor said his team is still discussing whether or not it will remove the plugin in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CoBlocks is already a suite of blocks that level-up the block editor, bringing in those gallery blocks into the core plugin removes a barrier for folks who already have CoBlocks installed,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Instead of folks having to install, activate, and maintain two plugins &#8211; only one is needed. On top of that, it’s far easier to maintain them collectively under one roof, as many of the components are shared between the two plugins.&#8221; </p>\n<p>In addition to merging the gallery blocks, CoBlocks 1.9.5 introduces a new Form block that allows users to customize a simple form directly within the editor. The block includes name, email, and message form fields but does not offer the ability to create new fields or change them to different types of fields. Users can set any of the fields as required using a toggle inside the block preview. For anything beyond these capabilities, a dedicated forms plugin would be required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-20-at-7.13.40-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>CoBlocks 1.9.5 also adds official support for Gutenberg 5.7 and includes more than a dozen tweaks and fixes. </p>\n<p>Tabor said his team is identifying further solutions that can be leveraged to make page building in WordPress more simple. CoBlocks is rapidly becoming a another one-stop shop for the mostly commonly used page building blocks. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at how to make adding maps easier (a better Map block) and developing a system that enables restaurants to build out menus,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Several other block collections already offer a map block and/or a similar suite of page building functionality, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghostkit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ghost Kit</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stackable</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Blocks</a>. Collections seem to be the best way to offer multiple small UI elements, especially if they are all designed to be complimentary in style. Plugin authors differentiate their collections from the others with additional block options, support, complimentary themes, and immediate compatibility with the Gutenberg plugin. </p>\n<p>At the moment, there is little incentive for developers to maintain functionality as separate plugins, but WordPress&#8217; planned single <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-explores-proposal-for-new-block-directory-to-host-single-block-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">block directory</a> may change the way blocks are packaged for optimal discovery. For now, it&#8217;s a race to see which block collection can offer the most useful suite with the most intuitive UI. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 May 2019 00:57:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Improves the Security of Automatic Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89913\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-improves-the-security-of-automatic-updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4791:\"<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-jaco-released-includes-fatal-php-error-protection-and-a-recovery-mode\">WordPress 5.2</a>, released earlier this month, added the first step towards fully secure updates with offline digital signatures. Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, <a href=\"https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet\"></a><a href=\"https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet\">explains</a><a href=\"https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet\"> how it works</a> and how developers can migrate away from mcrypt to libsodium.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When your WordPress site installs an automatic update, from version 5.2 onwards, it will first check for the existence of an <code>x-content-signature</code> header. </p><p>If one isn&#8217;t provided by the update server, your WordPress site will instead query for a <code>filenamehere.sig</code> file.</p><p>No matter how it&#8217;s delivered, the signatures are calculated using <a href=\"https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html#asymmetric-signatures\">Ed25519</a> of the SHA384 hash of the file&#8217;s contents. The signature is base64-encoded for safe transport.</p><cite>Scott Arciszewski</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress core development team manages the signing or secret keys. WordPress 5.2 contains a signing key that expires on April 1, 2021. The verification key or public key is used to decipher the secret key. This value determines the validity of the signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the feature is still in an experimental phase, WordPress 5.2 <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309#comment:85\">allows an update to occur</a> if a soft error or invalid signature is encountered. This is to prevent more severe errors from causing the user to be locked out of the update process until a manual update is applied. The team will use the reported error information to improve the signature checking process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital signatures are only supported for core updates with Themes and Plugins to follow in a later release. It&#8217;s also likely that the team will include separate keys for core releases, plugins, themes, translations, etc. to allow for more fine-grained control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital signatures applied to WordPress core updates is an important milestone because it prevents users from unknowingly downloading updates from malicious sources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, without digital signatures, if the server or servers that house the core update files were compromised, a false update could be sent to millions of sites. In 2016, WordFence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/11/hacking-27-web-via-wordpress-auto-update/\">explained how this scenario could play out</a> when they publicized a security vulnerability they discovered with api.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Persistence Pays Off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early 2017, Arciszewski <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871\">published a plea</a> to Matt Mullenweg to focus on securing WordPress&#8217; automatic updates system by using secure cryptographic signatures. Mullenweg responded to the article with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1\">one of his own</a> on Medium. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help.

Four months ago, Gary Pendergast, WordPress core developer, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309#comment:53\">responded to the ticket</a> saying that the feature fell in line with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">list of WordPress priorities</a> planned for 2019 and beyond.

The project&#8217;s previous versions used Ubuntu 14, which has now reached end of life (EOL). </p>\n<p>Support for VVV 2 is now discontinued, due to an unforeseen complication with its PHP dependencies. Ondřej Surý, who maintains all the PHP packages VVV uses, deleted the unsupported ones in response to Ubuntu 14 reaching EOL. VVV contributors had set up a package mirror but only 70% of them were mirrored. As a result, VVV 2 installs were no longer able to provision. VVV maintainers have stopped supporting it and it will not receive any fixes or updates in the future. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tomjn.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Nowell</a> said he and his fellow VVV maintainers had &#8220;a mini- Ubuntu 14-apocalypse of sorts when it reached EOL,&#8221; so the new Ubuntu 18 box is a big bump up that should cover the project until 2024. It includes Kernel improvements that make Ubuntu faster when used in a virtual machine. The 3.0 update came out of necessity but it includes changes the team had already intended to make.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to move from 14 to 18 for a long time anyway, and Anton Vanyukov had written a PR starting that, so we went ahead,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;The internals are based on VVV 2 so 99% of things should still work exactly the same (but a bit better and a little faster).&#8221; </p>\n<p>VVV now uses a leaner custom built box, but it requires users to destroy their VMs in order to update. Directions for updating to 3.0 are in the release <a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>. This destroys the database but VVV creates its own backups that can be quickly restored with a simple command.</p>\n<p>Another major change in 3.0 is that VVV no longer stores MariaDB data inside the VM. The data has been relocated to database/data, which has the added benefit of being preserved when using the <code>vagrant destroy</code> command.</p>\n<p>The release also includes quite a bit of restructuring with the removal of the /vagrant mapped folder that eliminates overlapping vagrant shared folders. In addition to several dozen smaller improvements, VVV 3.0 adds a new teddy bear when it finishes provisioning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-17-at-14.51.27.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>The Future of VVV: Version 4 to Focus on User-Friendly Improvements to Provisioning</h3>\n<p>Although VVV doesn&#8217;t yet have a user-friendly interface and requires the use of a terminal, Nowell said the team is working towards making it easier to use. For now, VVV distinguishes itself from other development apps, like Local and DesktopServer, by being a community project that is free from commercial interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;VVV does a lot of the things DesktopServer does but for free,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;We don’t charge $99 for PHP7, SSL, or WP CLI. VVV won’t up sell you on hosting either, and you can have as many sites as you want out of the box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people like Local for using Docker containers, but all those containers are inside a boot2docker virtual machine using VirtualBox. They have a pretty UI, and it’s great if you use FlyWheel as a host, but it’s not the easiest to get set up for contributing to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV has a specific pre-built version that provides a development environment <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/installing-vvv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">optimized for contributing to WordPress core</a>. It can be copied onto a USB drive and set up on a user&#8217;s machine, even while offline. This pre-built version is often handed out at the beginning of contributor days at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re a community driven project,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;People going to contributor days use VVV &#8211; the entire package can be pre-built and put on a USB stick and it runs in a lot more places than some of the docker based setups that some devs use. Until recently you needed to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro to be able to use Docker on Windows. Imagine 100 contributors downloading Windows 10 iso files over conference wifi.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV maintainers and contributors are working on releasing version 3.1 in the next month with all the little things they want to polish. Nowell said they have the basis for what they want to accomplish in version 4. Instead of waiting for VVV to install and configure PHP/MySQL/nginx/etc, the install process will happen on a server somewhere and the user will be able to just download the result, similar to how VVV is pre-built for contributor days.</p>\n<p>Nowell identified the major impacts of taking this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if provisioning works for you, we’re doing that for you.</li>\n<li>If someone makes a big slip up, that’s ok, users get the last working build and see nothing.</li>\n<li>Getting everything set up should be much much faster, it will remove about 70-80% of the startup time for a lot of users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nowell said the general goal is to &#8220;just make it more fun to use&#8221; but his personal goal is for people to be able to use VVV without ever touching a terminal. He thinks it can be done with an <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electron</a> wrapper and has performed a few experiments with it. In the past, he spent a lot of time improving the messaging for provisioning errors, but the days of trying to preempt those problems may soon be drawing to a close.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why fix provisioning for users if they never have to do it in the first place?&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;I’d say VVV 4 will come pre-built so it only builds the sites themselves, like how you can grab a docker image with PHP/MySQL already setup, and fill it with a site. Eventually the dashboard itself can become an Electron app where you can turn VVV on/off and adds sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV maintainers have some ambitious plans for version 4 that will make it available to a wider population of WordPress users and save existing users more time on startup. The project needs more testers and feature requests. Contributions to the main project are <a href=\"https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">welcome on GitHub</a>. Developers and testers can also contribute to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">meta environment</a> to improve how it works with WordCamp sites and WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 May 2019 21:11:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Block building without JavaScript: Testing ACF, Block Lab, and Lazy Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89780\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/block-building-without-javascript-testing-acf-block-lab-and-lazy-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19359:\"<p>Not everyone is able or willing to build blocks in JavaScript just yet, and sometimes you have to install three or four block collections until you find the blocks you would like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a third way: plugins that create the blocks for you from a set of specific custom fields, with a template to control the frontend display of the blocks. The three most popular options for doing this include: <a href=\"https://getblocklab.com/\">Block Lab</a>, <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/\">ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)</a> and <a href=\"https://lazyblocks.com/\">Lazy Blocks</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My use case for this test is a small task I set out to accomplish with each of the plugins &#8211; to create a block for team members of a company that includes the following fields: first name, last name, headshot, bio, phone number, and email address and use the block on a page in a two-column display with two team members. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each plugin I will demonstrate</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how to create the Fieldgroup, </li><li>how to create the template for the frontend and </li><li>how to use the blocks to create a team page. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://localbyflywheel.com/\">Local by Flywheel </a>as my local development tool.

I used Block Lab first, installed the plugin and then started a new block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the video on how to set-up the fields. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iRgsUvVQRzimcktaj1845VVoYcWmt0THZv56Xrn1CGF549wAA7iC1DoQNr0-ZhZnPQ6iXk7LULp6PFuazN-KfBvoaNvPFf3Cobsdwt6HBhT6HbKOz9tQ7tq-y5oC0W6uyLL9_RY3\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EanmmdAsFYGbcXr1ygb8FHMmRWUTVTH1stMIqg0YnZ8XIPziPLfv9fmC5dKWAnZyNkxOShxuzueW2ByPZOaJobqWlqORw35pk3hEBDx7UhjdB05HU0yf8enxtqIBY1TONAJWELlt\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is setting up the block template </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I looked at the expected location, the template will be made part of the theme directory in a subfolder called /blocks/ That’s something a developer needs to remember, as there is some content lock-in when switching themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the template, I opened my code editor, created the file block-team-member.php, and added the HTML + and minimal PHP to reference the fields. </p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;h2&gt;\n&lt;?php block_field( \'first-name\' );?&gt; \n&lt;?php block_field( \'last-name\' );?&gt;\n&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"teamphoto\" src=\"&lt;?php block_field( \'picture\' ); ?&gt;\"\n alt=\"&lt;?php block_field( \'first-name\' );?&gt; \n&lt;?php block_field( \'last-name\' );?&gt; \" width=\"150\" style=\"float:left;padding:4px;margin;2px;\"/&gt;\n&lt;?php block_field( \'short-bio\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can reach &lt;?php block_field( \'first-name\' );?&gt;&lt;/em&gt; \n&lt;br/&gt;via email &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:&lt;?php block_field( \'email-address\' ); ?&gt;\"&gt;\n&lt;?php block_field( \'email-address\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n or &lt;br/&gt;\nvia phone: &lt;span&gt;&lt;?php block_field( \'extension\' ); ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pj0rCDeug3wI8j6NJbIGB03095ZcSRxopKs8Lj_g1ZK3m2cce8GxuK6q55tZvXIkU4YA-qdgwPWirkPzaBV7TbfkMftmWyNmAtHoFKA5KgRcddlW0pF0Em2_eGRzGVgWO6Xt_4on\" alt=\"\" width=\"217\" height=\"402\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last step, I finished the configuration of this block with the Block Properties </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I set the icon to a person, </li><li>selected the “Layout Elements” as Category and </li><li>added “team member, team” as keywords</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All this is necessary for the Block inserter in the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see how it works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I added a new Page called <strong>Meet our Block Lab Team</strong> and added the team members, using the Block “Team Member”.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I decided to have all the information filled within the block editor boundaries. During setup of the fieldgroup, I had also the choice to display form controls in the Block Options tab in the sidebar. For the moment, I have determined that’s it’s just personal preference. Once you click outside the block, the form disappears and the block is rendered similar to its frontend representation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/49oYuT1N3zL8kgT0ojON3E5s4RgJlS9wJHou2fwgUAGEwaP0LOyuuQ4DZmTm2EUpcHJXRluW_tFlvj_coY62gTteq6ep1kJKTrUTR7lbuV5w276LNlxGJikJwdY51KPvVeyBB5Mh\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I have the block finalized, I can add more team members to the page. I decided, I’d like them in a column block with two columns. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XgDmfWQFlv6oN12gTeoZ9wA4JN0lvf_FGeWTLK3RfmWfAKXjQ9E_GOvY5kTKDPJRyAcSP36u1VTMkGI5kwiZ8mUQJnCKQSKYZdE-G6io645EsTyp2V4CfMXrCotH8Och1vGEWUjK\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good. I was not thrilled that the location of the template points to the theme folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I want to switch out the theme, I still would like to keep the block and the layout for the block with my site, so I would need to make sure to copy the blocks folder to the new theme’s directory. Another way is outlined in the &nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/getblocklab/block-lab/wiki/3.-Displaying-custom-blocks\">documentation for Blocklab on Github</a>. It offers two filters to change the default location of the template: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“To use a different template inside your theme, use the block_lab_override_theme_template( $theme_template ) filter. </em><em>To use a different template outside your theme (for example, in a plugin), use the block_lab_template_path( $template_path ) filter.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was fairly easy to set up, even if you are not a PHP developer, you can probably use the one PHP function block-field() and make sure to reference the right field names. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Lab, in essence, provides you with a method to create the fields and configure the block properties in one screen, and then you need to add the corresponding block template to a folder /blocks/ in your theme’s directory.  It&#8217;s fairly straight forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a Team Block with ACF 5.8 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) version 5.8 came out with a block builder (only available in the Pro version). For my test I used ACF 5.8 RC 1. The final release is available now.  Elliot Condon is the plugin’s author and the first version was released in 2011. The plugin has grown into a hugely popular developer tool for freelancers and agencies alike and has over 1 million installs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its success and versatility make the creation of the field group a more involved process compared to the other two plugins. The Pro version 5.8 contains the first release of its block building tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the admin view of the Field group “Team Member”. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/63PvvK9vJx7T38CSlED8q91thMJh3qToA1bGuKDmBaQQGNsEDndfT4z1KkFFx9fISlt8pnWfq6lrnnoAy11YKmlhXiz-GmydV7sB91YorPT5QGfI46CEWLzY22sfsS-krFn_Aa-1\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now how do I make this into a block? <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/\">The documentation</a> is comprehensive enough. &nbsp;Note: In this test I went in a slightly different order… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with the Field Group and I needed to get back to that admin screen after I registered the block (see below) .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I &nbsp;used two files. First, I needed to register the block in the <em>functions.php</em> of my theme. For the template/block rendering code I used <em>content-block-team-member.php</em> also to be stored in the active theme’s folder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see how those two fit together in a second. The rest of the work is done by the plugin in the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So let’s write the Block Code in PHP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first snippet is the block registration. I gave it a name, title, a description, point to the render template, give it a category, an icon and some keywords, under which the content producer can find the block in the Block Inserter. I scrolled all the way to the end of my theme’s <em>functions.php</em> and added this snippet:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\nfunction register_acf_blocks() {\n   // register a team member block.\n   acf_register_block(array(\n       \'name\'              =&gt; \'acf-team-member\',\n       \'title\'             =&gt; __(\'ACF Team Member\'),\n       \'description\'       =&gt; __(\'A custom team member block created via ACF 5.8\'),\n       \'render_template\'   =&gt; \'content-block-team-member.php\',\n       \'category\'          =&gt; \'formatting\',\n       \'icon\'              =&gt; \'admin-comments\',\n       \'keywords\'          =&gt; array( \'team member\', \'team\' ),\n   ));\n}\n// Check if function exists and hook into setup.\nif( function_exists(\'acf_register_block\') ) {\n   add_action(\'acf/init\', \'register_acf_blocks\');\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>This code is straight from the <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/\">documentation</a> and I just changed a few values. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section I created the block rendering template. The file name needs to match the “render_template” attribute in the above text, which is “<strong>content-block-team-member.php</strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just followed <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/#key-concepts\">along ACF’s documentation</a> and only changed a few values and updated the display code. </p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\n&lt;pre class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code\"&gt;&lt;?php\n// create id attribute for specific styling\n$id = \'team-member\' . $block[\'id\'];\n\n// create align class (\"alignwide\") from block setting (\"wide\")\n$align_class = $block[\'align\'] ? \'align\' . $block[\'align\'] : \'\';\n\n// Load values and asigning defaults for the block fields.\n$short_bio = get_field(\'short_bio\') ?: \'the short bio goes here... \';\n$first_name = get_field(\'first_name\') ?: \'First Name\';\n$last_name = get_field(\'last_name\') ?: \'Last Name\';\n$image = get_field(\'picture\');\n$email_address = get_field(\'email_address\');\n$extension = get_field(\'extension\');\n?&amp;gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\" class=\"team-member \"&amp;gt;\n       &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n   &lt;blockquote class=\"team-member-blockquote\"&gt;\n   &lt;img class=\"teamphoto\"&gt;\" alt=\"\" alt=\"  \" width=\"150\" style=\"float:left;padding:4px;margin;2px;\"/&amp;gt;\n       &lt;span class=\"team-member-short-bio\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;br /&gt;\n       &lt;span class=\"team-membe-extension\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n       &lt;span class=\"team-membe-email-address\"&gt;\n       &lt;/span&gt;\n   &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>As I started with the Fieldgroup, I needed to go back and make sure that the group is associated with the block I just registered. &nbsp;Below the Fieldgroup screen I created a rule for the Location: It needs to read:  “Show this field group if the <strong>Block</strong> is equal to <strong>ACF Team Member. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dNTCzxoXnT8IKlgMBkZKhhcKAyuj6AyZVF5wRHn4rhKGEPt4MTBkmR5rkyxLk_Nl1RZAaiU_sMDplVlmRcVJz7b6xjcbgmEJ0tAJVHllcNzJzEuqUQhUhzwvxFD1-pd8Ahhp28FR\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s see how this works in the Block editor when I add two members. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an interesting experience. You can use the form in the editor section to enter the data. Another option is to enter the data in the form fields available in the the sidebar and you see the block update in real time. You can toggle between the two methods but clicking on the Button “Switch to Edit” or “Switch to Preview” depending which method you are using right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uihtOmYm4w4yeWo3F116ZTzgr7ESRlgTpOOeOgrI_IWXM4QMJIzs-tjOSnt0o1rnp0EQPIUZE990pMCDvGgjDXS8LhkxBFHAgZnGYZhwYO_DObXU51wuwZcfWOUX_DlMXIJy8Y5E\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor UI works well. It’s worth going through the more elaborate setup and code necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a Team Block with Lazy Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third plugin in this test is called “Lazy Blocks” by Nikita of nkdev.info, the same team that also published the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghostkit/\">GhostKit</a> block collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It not only allows me to store information in post_content but I also get a choice to store it in the post_meta table. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a video of using the interface to create the fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As this admin screen is focused on getting all the information to create the blocks, on the left I created my fields and in the sidebar. &nbsp;I filled in the information needed to register a block with the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath,  I was  able to add the HTML for frontend and backend. The syntax is even easier than Block Lab, and of course much easier than ACF’s  templating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t need to add any code to my theme’s functions.php nor did I need to create additional files with my template code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add it all right here, aided by syntax highlighting and merge tags rather than function calls. &nbsp;The <a href=\"https://lazyblocks.com/documentation/getting-started/\">documentation shows multiple ways</a> to write your template code. I am definitely a fan of <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars (semantic templating)</a> as it is in this context much closer to other systems’ merge tags. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n048DkWcRrFC5Z6Y17GgeTYrL_mIMfARYJt71-S7aZx-v6NIkL94QYIsvJr0eWk4pejhgQjBr5-QECpi16qRbQsXOOq_5HoDSN2qGlHejMr7kLfq9qNAeenG7xIjGhnOM6pCcXyp\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I copy/pasted the same code into the “Editor HTML” tab, so I could see the frontend display below the form fields. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s use it. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Eqo6z_IfKoAahVP3pNl4TyDc1zAffiOUbLHD1H07DCevQORZkRC-9vyKh6jTFq3djhm840806ktf5PdkrARuCWyRvf0KFCpwHG3JyuHGfEUfMuhMkEkp-SOekYTt9ZDUAsSpS4_O\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This seems to work. It was little bit awkward that the form didn’t disappear when I unselect the block. It takes up a lot of real estate in the editor. Although, I wanted to have the team members in a two-column block, I did not succeed in dragging and dropping the two blocks into a Column Block. I mentioned this in my <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/remove-form-when-block-is-not-selected/\">support topic </a>and nK answered: “&#8230;hiding controls when the block is not selected is a good feature, that already added in ACF Blocks and will be added in Lazy Blocks soon.” Here you have it &#8211; all in due time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Complex, Evolved, or Easy. &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\"><strong>ACF 5.8</strong></a> &nbsp;has a very robust block building feature, and every one who has been using the plugin to build sites will be very happy to be able and create dynamic blocks for their customers. It’s well thought through, and developers of all skill sets will get up and running quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone, who is not well versed in PHP will have her fair share of trial and error to get it all going. It will get even more complicated when the requirements for the blocks get more involved and beyond this test’s use case. This is not a tool for WordPress beginners or DIY site implementers who don’t write a lot of code themselves. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, only the ACF 5.8 Pro version comes with the block builder feature. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1112934364751396865\">Condon is contemplating making it a stand alone plugin</a>. (See what the Twitteratti think about the idea… ) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://getblocklab.com/\">Block Lab </a></strong>is in its early stages of development. It succeeds in abstracting most of the block architecture and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. The documentation is very helpful. The template is stored in a separate file, and needs to be maintained with the rest of the theme files. If we at my company would use it for any of our projects, we would store the template file with one of our helper plugins, so our customers are able to switch themes without losing the content and display of the blocks built with Block Lab. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro version boasts additional features, such as repeater fields, import/export of blocks, user object fields, map field and many more block features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP is an agency working with enterprise clients on the WordPress.com VIP hosting and other corporations. Their team members are contributing to other big ideas in the WordPress space,<a href=\"https://xwp.co/project/customizer/\"> including the Customizer</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://xwp.co/project/google-amp/\">AMP</a> and <a href=\"https://xwp.co/project/tide/\">Tide</a>. I expect the plugin to stay around and grow with Gutenberg Phase 2 into a robust system for site implementers, agencies, and theme developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://lazyblocks.com/\">Lazy Blocks</a></strong><a href=\"https://lazyblocks.com/\"> </a>is a delight to set up and as mentioned, I am a fan of the <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handelbars</a> templating syntax. It’s easy to learn even for beginners, and with a little practice, a site owner would be able to create specific Gutenberg blocks for their site. The block handling in the editor although functioning, is a little clunky, as the display doesn’t switch between block select state and unselect state at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a requirement of having additional fields for a page or a section of a post, Lazy Blocks is a great tool to prototype and get quickly from idea to proof of concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only caveat: I was not able to find out who the people are behind <em>nkdev.info</em> and the name Nikita. The website only reveals that it is a young company but nothing more. If you use the plugin, make sure you have Plan B in place just in case the developers abandon the plugin before it takes off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF 5.8 is quite complex; Block Lab is a very flexible and only semi-complex; and Lazy Blocks is adequately named and the easiest to use. None of them lets you get away without writing code, as each block needs some display output in HTML. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know what you think about these three block generating plugins. Also, if you found another plugin that allows you to build blocks without getting into Javascript, I want to know about it! Please share your thoughts and discoveries in the comments! </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 May 2019 22:42:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: HostCamp: An Unconference For Advancing the WordPress Infrastructure\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89739\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/hostcamp-an-unconference-for-advancing-the-wordpress-infrastructure\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1922:\"<p><a href=\"https://hostcamp.org/\">HostCamp</a> is a small, semi-informal, invitation-only, event with an <a href=\"http://unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/\">unconference style</a> that is bringing leaders together from within the hosting industry to discuss and share ideas on how to advance the WordPress infrastructure across the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizing team is comprised of, Jonathan Wold, Ecosystem Consultant, Formerly VP of Strategy at XWP, Mile Rosu, Co-founder and CEO of Presslabs, Mihai Grescenko, Head of Design at Desero, Anna Maria Radu, Event producer for DigiTales, and Andreea Oproiu, Communication and PR specialist for DigiTales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hostcamp.org/program/\">Speakers</a> will present on a variety of topics including, malware, ethics in WordPress hosting, PHP versions, portability, and more. <a href=\"https://www.betahaus.com/\">Betahaus</a>, a network and co-working facility in Berlin, Germany, is hosting the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Betahaus Facility in Berlin, Germany</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosu describes the unconference as, &#8220;A launchpad for innovations in the hosting industry where opportunities in WordPress infrastructure are encouraged and promoted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in attending, there is an application form near the bottom of the <a href=\"https://hostcamp.org/\">HostCamp site</a> that is available until June 1st.

In 2019, Automattic now employs more than 900 people from 68 countries who have all worked in a distributed fashion since day one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the Distributed podcast I wanted to take a closer look at how some of the most innovative companies and brilliant minds think about the future of work,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Not just the binary questions of &#8216;remote work&#8217; vs. &#8216;office work,&#8217; but the wider spectrum of what’s possible and why it matters. How can we work better and smarter in the decades to come—and what’s the moral imperative driving our desire to change?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/podcast/\">episode</a> of the podcast features <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upwork</a> CEO <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/skasriel\" target=\"_blank\">Stephane Kasriel</a>, who  is deeply embedded in the labor market for remote work. His company offers a global platform for connecting businesses with freelancers. Upwork went public in 2018 and is expected to do more than $1.7 billion in business this year. Kasriel has a wealth of knowledge to share from his experience managing more than 1,100 remote freelancers in 500 cities, in addition to 400 on-site employees.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our mission at this company is to create economic opportunities for people to have better lives, and the way we measure that is how much money goes into people&#8217;s pockets,&#8221; Kasriel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Mullenweg and Kasriel are passionate about seeing more companies embrace remote work and the first part of the podcast goes deeper into what is currently broken about work. Those living in big cities are often paid well for their talents and expertise but will spend a large portion of that money on the cost of living. Kasriel said he believes Upwork can be a &#8220;driving force in creating a better future&#8221; by championing remote work as the economic catalyst for improving working conditions across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This distributed-company movement is the awakening of the tech industry [to the reality] that we are part of the problem,&#8221; Kasriel said. &#8220;Part of the reason why jobs have been destroyed in plenty of places in the country while all the new jobs were created in a small number of areas is because of tech.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are curious about how CEOs and managers make distributed work a success, the first episode includes discussions on some of the more practical issues of managing a remote work force. Mullenweg and Kasriel discuss the challenges of working across timezones, strategies for improving communication and  preventing employees from feeling a sense of isolation, and managing productivity and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topics included in the episode are even applicable for smaller distributed companies that are just starting out. Kasriel shared tips on establishing a strong culture of employee satisfaction for both on-site employees and those working remotely, navigating conflict, integrating new employees into remote culture, and allowing people to &#8220;delocate&#8221; from on-site work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After listening to this episode, I found that Mullenweg and Kasriel presented a compelling case that distributed work is not just a buzzword in the tech industry.  It is actually a movement with a powerful economic impact that is poised to change the world. Remote work also has the added benefit of creating opportunities for people who have a difficult time participating in the traditional labor market, effectively increasing the diversity of a company&#8217;s employees by offering a more inclusive model for working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The podcast is produced by Mark Armstrong and the team at <a href=\"https://www.chartsandleisure.com/\">Charts &amp; Leisure</a>.  There&#8217;s a lot of valuable information efficiently packed into just 37 minutes.

It was interesting to hear how Stephane’s teams balance in-person culture with inclusiveness for all employees, no matter where they live.

In previous versions of the editor, it wasn&#8217;t easy to see if a block had been inserted as a child block, especially since the default behavior was to insert an empty paragraph block. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 5.7</a> brings more clarity to the UI for Group blocks by displaying the new block appender as the default state when no inner blocks are detected. (The &#8220;appender&#8221; is the fancy name for the button with the plus sign inside it that opens the UI for inserting a new block.) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-15-at-5.53.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Columns block has also been updated to add the new block appender, and this release adds support for setting column widths. The inflexibility of the Columns block has been a frustration for users since it was introduced, but this release makes progress on one of the most common requests. Users can now set a percentage width for the columns in the block settings. The UI for this is a bit clunky, but a more interactive, draggable column resizer handle is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15659\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">coming in a future release</a>. Future iterations may also include &#8220;quick-select&#8221; template options for users to select from when setting up their columns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-15-at-9.42.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other new features in this release include support for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14627\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">showing post content or an excerpt in the Latest Posts block</a> and support for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15409\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">header and footer toggles in the Table block</a>.</p>\n<p>One handy little addition to Gutenberg 5.7 is the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14983\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update images using drag &#038; drop</a>. Users can now drag an image onto an image block that already contains an image. The image will be uploaded and will replace the previous one, saving users many clicks in the process of changing an image. Future updates may also add the same behavior to the audio, video, file, and Media &#038; Text blocks.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.7 includes dozens of bug fixes and accessibility improvements, with several suggestions that originated from WPCampus&#8217; accessibility audit. It also brings a significant boost in performance with a 14% faster loading time than the previous version.<br />\n﻿<br />\nThe project&#8217;s documentation has <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a new home on WordPress DevHub</a> and has been reorganized for better navigation.</p>\n<p>A list of all the changes in the 5.7 release is available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">release

You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for cataract surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

This angle has a sieve-like structure that is known as the trabecular meshwork.\r\n<strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)</strong>This is the most common type of glaucoma, which usually occurs in old age.

Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n						<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs &amp; Symptoms of Cataract <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">A cataract starts out small, and at first, has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions.

People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n						<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n						<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion active\">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Signs &amp; Symptoms of Cataract <span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">A cataract starts out small, and at first, has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision has blurred a little, as if you are looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">What Causes Cataracts?<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, which focuses light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\n					The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it.\r\n\r\n					However, as we age, some of the protein is likely to clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, which makes it difficult for us to see properly.\r\n\r\n					No one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts. Researchers across the worldhave identified factors that are likely to cause cataracts or are associated with the development of the same. Besides advancing age, the risk factors associated with cataract include:\r\n					<ul>\r\n						<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n						<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n						<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n						<li>Obesity</li>\r\n						<li>Smoking</li>\r\n						<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n						<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n						<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n						<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n						<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n						<li>High myopia</li>\r\n						<li>Family history</li>\r\n					</ul>\r\n					One popular theoryabout cataract formation is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory is supported by nutrition studies, which indicate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, is likely to help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-title\">Cataract Treatment<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n				<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n\r\n					<p>When symptoms begin to appear, one is likely to be able to improve one’s vision for a while by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>With the modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery when the cataract has progressed enough to impair ones vision and has started affecting one’s daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n					<p>Many people consider poor vision as an inevitable process of aging,however, cataract surgery is a simple and relatively painless procedure.</p>\r\n					<ul><li>\r\n						<h3>Cataract surgery –</h3>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial Intraocular Lens (IOL) that has the appropriate power.</p>\r\n\r\n						<p>Cataract surgery is not just the removal of the cataract, but also the correction of the refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOLs are being developed constantly to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons, and for the lenses to be more useful for patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOLs potentially enablepatients to see at varying distances, and not just one distance. Another new type of IOL blocks ultraviolet as well as blue light rays, which, according to research, are likely to cause damage to the retina.</p></li>\r\n						<li>\r\n							<h3>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h3>\r\n\r\n							<p>Cataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the entire duration of the eye surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument that breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens that is injected through a small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n							<p>The surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.</p>\r\n						</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n					</div>\r\n				</div>\r\n\r\n				<div class=\"accordion \">\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-title\">Facilities for cataract surgery<span class=\"float-right\">+</span></div>\r\n					<div class=\"accordion-desc\">\r\n						<ul>\r\n							<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag StreitLenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n							<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina, and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel-like structure, known as the vitreous, which helps transmit light to the retina as well as maintains the structure of the retina. Loss of clarity of the vitreous can occur in a condition known as vitreous haemorrhage (due to the accumulation of blood). Grave conditions that can lead to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from the retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary &amp; acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults, but also newborns. Premature babies are highly prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), which, if not treated on time, can progress to retinal detachment and eventually, in loss of vision. Retina is also likely to be affected by trauma and common medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Various medical and surgical treatments are available for the above-mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully every day. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to patients for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe retina department of H.V.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','publish','closed','closed','','retina','','','2019-06-11 12:09:20','2019-06-11 12:09:20','',0,'http://local.hvd.com/?post_type=facilities&#038;p=74',0,'facilities','',0),(75,1,'2019-05-03 08:08:11','2019-05-03 08:08:11','','Retina','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Desai Eye Hospital specialises in dealing with all types of glaucoma, including primary, secondary, paediatric and end-stage glaucoma. At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','A speciality clinic of H.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\n\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\n\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\n</ul>\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\n\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\n\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\n\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\n\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','inherit','closed','closed','','74-autosave-v1','','','2019-06-11 12:07:18','2019-06-11 12:07:18','',74,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/05/05/74-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(92,1,'2019-05-05 10:46:10','2019-05-05 10:46:10','','Glaucoma','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

Some examples include contacts following injury or corneal transplantation, contacts with artificial iris, and contacts for eye conditions such as keratoconus and Aphakia.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Service</h2>\r\nThe Contact Lens Service evaluates and fits patients of all ages using the latest in contact lens technology and information, often before it has even been introduced in the general eye practitioner\'s office. The Directors of the service are national leaders in the contact lens field and participate in major national studies on advances in contact lenses. Contact lenses allow normal vision for people with a wide range of medical conditions. This includes patient who have:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Keratoconus</li>\r\n 	<li>Corneal transplantations</li>\r\n 	<li>Irregular or scarred corneas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInfants and young children often have various visual conditions that require a contact lens so that their vision system can develop normally. We offer every type of contact lens, including:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Hard</li>\r\n 	<li>Gas-permeable</li>\r\n 	<li>Daily-wear soft</li>\r\n 	<li>Extended-wear contact lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Coloured lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Disposable lenses</li>\r\n 	<li>Cosmetic lenses (to change eye colour)</li>\r\n 	<li>Prosthetic Lenses ( to hide the ocular surface disorders)</li>\r\n 	<li>Specialized keratoconus lenses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a major eye hospital, PBMA’s H. V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

At times , a depot steroid injection is used which causes slow release of drug into the eye .The drug usually lasts for several weeks and close monitoring of such patients is required with regular follow ups.\r\n\r\nUveitis with glaucoma, uveitis with vitreoretinal complications are handled in close cooperation with specialized Consultants in the respective fields.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is well equipped with modern machines, instruments and facilities fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, Indocyanin green angiography, ultrasonography, ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography.\r\n\r\nThe Department has taken up many research projects in this section :\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A Phase 3 trial-Controlled ,Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye.</li>\r\n 	<li>PEACHTREE:A Phase 3 trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension for the Treatment of Subjects with Macular Edema associated with Non-Infectious Uveitis.</li>\r\n 	<li>A Multicentre, Controlled ,Safety and Efficacy Study of s Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert in Subjects with Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Uveitis','Uveal tract is the vascular middle coat of the eye ball.

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. The state-of-the-art facilities available at PBMA’s H.V Desai Eye Hospital include High end Biometry &amp; Operative Planning modules; Phacoemulsification systems &amp; Operating Microscopes which enable us to perform Phacoemulsification (Micro incision suture less surgery) and Small Incision Cataract surgery.\r\n<h2>Facilities for cataract surgery</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag Streit Lenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n 	<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nThus all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 gm are screened for ROP. Any baby declared as high risk by the neonatologist is also screened. The first screening takes place by 30 days of birth. The modalities for screening, available at our hospital are two wide field cameras that are unique in the aspect to screen small babies, by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam, which is a U. S. based digital camera system.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra- a digital camera developed in India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf any abnormality is found on screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the clinical pictures. As these are digital photographs, the retinal images are also shown to the parents, helping to make them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nTreatment for ROP is given most commonly by laser therapy after using anaesthetic drops. In very advanced cases we also provide other options like intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery. Babies are continued to be checked till 3 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra to have a dedicated ROP service, hence catering to population all over the state. Also, it is one of the only hospitals in India to provide surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune having an NICU support. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. Also, Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra- Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are given training in this institute, in collaboration with the government.\r\n\r\nSo far we have screened more than 10,000 babies, out of which more than 1000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been done in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and prevented blindness.\r\n<h1>VR SPECIALITY</h1>\r\nRetina is a delicate multilayered film at the innermost posterior part of the eyeball which transmits light into nerve impulses and sends them to the brain via optic nerve for perception of visual images. Macula is the most sensitive part of the retina and is responsible for central vision. In the posterior segment, the eyeball is filled with a transparent gel like structure called the vitreous which helps in transmitting light to the retina and also maintains the structure of retina. Loss of clarity of vitreous can occur in a condition called vitreous haemorrhage (due to accumulation of blood). Grave conditions which can lead to up to total loss of vision are retinal detachment (neurosensory retina gets separated from retinal pigment epithelium) and hereditary and acquired macular diseases. Retinal diseases can not only affect adults but newborns as well. Premature babies are most prone to develop a condition called Retinopathy of prematurity which if not treated on time can progress to retinal detachment and eventual loss of vision. Retina can be affected by trauma and common medical conditions like diabetes , hypertension.\r\n\r\nVarious medical and surgical treatments are available for the above mentioned conditions. Complicated vitreo-retinal surgeries are performed successfully everyday. Various types of lasers and intravitreal injections are given to the patients in which it is indicated. Retinopathy of prematurity is also treatment with laser and intravitreal injections.\r\n\r\nThe retina department in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital is flourishing under the valuable guidance and experience of the head of department, Dr. Sucheta Kulkarni, who has an expertise in medical retina, public health and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nFacilities available at H. V. Desai Hospital are:\r\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Retcam examination- Advanced high resolution imaging technology for consistency of reports to detect retinopathy of prematurity, detailed evaluation without long exposure of newborns to the examination procedure and documentation. Highly trained personal available for the use of such advanced technology.</li>\r\n 	<li>Ultrasonography- to view intraocular structures in opaque media and trauma.</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus fluorescein angiography – to view leaking vessels, neovascularization and non perfused areas of the retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Indocyanine green angiography- to view choroidal circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>Fundus photography- for detailed viewing and documentation of retinal images</li>\r\n 	<li>Optical coherence tomography- to evaluate retinal thickness in cases of edema, to detect macular holes, tumours, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane and various other retinal diseases</li>\r\n 	<li>Electroretinography – to graphically represent functional capacity of the retinal cells.</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual evoked potential- used to measure electrical activity of visual system to detect mechanical and neural abnormalities related to vision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Various lasers are used to stabilise retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, vascular diseases, tumours, retinopathy of prematurity and many more. These are delivered either with the help of a slit lamp or by indirect ophthalmoscope. Diode, frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser and argon laser are available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Transpupillary thermotherapy is used in tumours to damage the abnormally growing vessels while causing minimal trauma to normal retina.</li>\r\n 	<li>Intravitreal injections- Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat conditions in which there is growth of new abnormal leaky vessels due to underlying disease which has caused ischaemia of the retina. It can also be used in cases of macula edema. Intravitreal steroids can also be used to effectively treat macular edema. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat grave ocular infections to effectively deliver these drugs into the eyeball.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>VITREO-RETINAL SURGERY</h1>\r\nPars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil or gas injection, core vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane peeling, macular hole surgery and intraocular foreign body removal are performed regularly in H. V. Desai eye hospital. Modern day surgeries use smaller size trocar/ cannula systems like 23G, 25G and 27G. These help in better wound reconstruction and healing and avoid post- operative infections. All the vitreous-retinal surgeries in H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are performed by highly educated skilled surgeons who have years of valuable experience in this field.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in

Opthalomolgy </strong></div>\n\nPaediatric Ophthalmology and Squint Department:\n\nVision impairment in childhood has a dramatic impact not only on the social development of a child, but also on his/her learning ability and potential. As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\n\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\n\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\n\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\n\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

Opacity occurring in the lens is called cataract. Cataract formation is a natural part of the aging process. It may occur due to injury or may be present at birth, but the most common cause is related to age (Senile Cataract) and is the leading cause of reversible blindness in India.\r\n\r\nModern day cataract surgery, includes not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error with the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. The state-of-the-art facilities available at PBMA’s H.V Desai Eye Hospital include High end Biometry &amp; Operative Planning modules; Phacoemulsification systems &amp; Operating Microscopes which enable us to perform Phacoemulsification (Micro incision suture less surgery) and Small Incision Cataract surgery.\r\n<h2>Facilities for cataract surgery</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Biometry machines – Zeiss IOL master, Haag Streit Lenstar, Pentacam</li>\r\n 	<li>Operative planning modules – Alcon Verion – only centre in Pune having this machine – Pre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is a normal aging process in the eye.\r\n\r\nCataract is the most common cause of vision loss in people over the age of 40 years and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are greater number of cataract cases worldwide than the combined cases of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\r\n<h2>Types of cataracts include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>A sub-capsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a sub-capsular cataract.</li>\r\n 	<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts usually are associated with aging.</li>\r\n 	<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacity that starts in the periphery of the lens and works their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>CATARACT SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</h1>\r\nA cataract starts out small and at first has little effect on your vision. You may notice that your vision is blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of glass or viewing an impressionist painting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDue to cataract, light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring. While driving at night, one may notice that the incoming headlights from another vehicle, cause more glare than before. Different colors, may not appear as bright as they once did.\r\n\r\nThe type of cataract one has, will give out signs and symptoms, specific to its characteristics and duration. When a nuclear cataract first develops, it can bring about a temporary improvement in one\'s near vision, called \'second sight.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the improved vision is short-lived and will disappear as the cataract advances and worsens. On the other hand, a sub-capsular cataract may not produce any symptoms until it is well developed. Sub-capsular cataracts experience discomfort from headlights of vehicles at night.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, wherein one experiences such signs and symptoms or cannot see well, have an inkling tht one may have developed cataract in ones eye, one must consult an ophthalmologist, for an exam to find out for sure and take necessary treatment, as prescribed by the ophthalmologist.\r\n<h1>WHAT CAUSES CATARACTS?</h1>\r\nThe lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye\'s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.\r\n\r\nThe lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.\r\n\r\nBut as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it difficult to see properly.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for sure why the lens of the eye changes as we age, thereby forming cataracts.Researchers, worldwide, have identified factors that may cause cataracts or are associated with cataract development. Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and other sources</li>\r\n 	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n 	<li>Hypertension</li>\r\n 	<li>Obesity</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoking</li>\r\n 	<li>Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications</li>\r\n 	<li>Statin medicines used to reduce cholesterol</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li>\r\n 	<li>Previous eye surgery</li>\r\n 	<li>Hormone replacement therapy</li>\r\n 	<li>Significant alcohol consumption</li>\r\n 	<li>High myopia</li>\r\n 	<li>Family history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne theory, of cataract formation, which is gaining favor is that many cataracts are caused by oxidative changes in the human lens. This theory, is supported by nutrition studies which show that consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are said to be high in antioxidants, may help prevent certain types of cataracts (see below).\r\n<h1>CATARACT PREVENTION</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThough there is major controversy about whether cataract can be prevented, a number of studies suggest consumption of certain nutrients and nutritional supplements which may reduce the risk of development of cataract. Higher dietary intake of vitamin E and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin from food and supplements may decrease risk of cataract.\r\n\r\nAnother step one can take to reduce risk of cataract is to wear protective sunglasses that block 100 percent of the UV rays emitted by the sun, when one is outdoors.\r\n<h1>CATARACT TREATMENT</h1>\r\nWhen symptoms begin to appear, one may be able to improve ones vision, for a while, by using new glasses, strong bifocals, magnification, having appropriate lighting or other visual aids.\r\n\r\nWith modern surgical techniques available today, one does not need to wait for the cataract to mature fully. One can go in for surgery, when the cataract has progressed enough, to impair ones vision and affect ones daily life.\r\n\r\nMany people, consider poor vision as an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain lost vision.\r\n<h1>CATARACT SURGERY –</h1>\r\nCataract surgery, is now a short and painless procedure, during which the surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear, artificial intraocular lens (IOL) having the appropriate power.\r\n\r\nCataract surgery is not just removal of cataract but also correction of refractive error for distant and near vision. It also provides the option of freedom from spectacles after surgery. New IOL\'s are being developed, constantly, to enable the surgery to be less complicated for surgeons and the lenses to be more useful to the patients. Presbyopia-correcting (Multifocal) IOL\'s potentially help one see at varying distances, not just one distance. Another new type of IOL ,blocks both ultraviolet and blue light rays - which research indicates may be the cause of damage to the retina.\r\n<h1>SURGICAL PROCEDURE:</h1>\r\nCataract surgery can be done under anaesthetic drops (no injection). However, some patients may require anaesthetic injection near the eye. The patient does not experience discomfort and is advised to lie still for the duration of the eye surgery.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is removed through a very small incision using a phacoemulsification instrument which breaks up the cataract using ultrasonic waves. The cataract is then sucked out of the eye. The cataractous lens is then replaced by a suitable artificial, foldable lens injected through the small incision.\r\n\r\nThe surgery is performed in a sterile operating theatre, using complete aseptic precautions. The surgery can be performed within 20-30 minutes.\r\n<h2>Advanced refractive cataract surgery is available at this hospital:</h2>\r\nAdvanced equipments, for accurate measurement and surgery.\r\n<h1>BIOMETRY MACHINES – FOR ACCURATE IOL POWER CALCULATIONS</h1>\r\nZeiss IOL master, Haag-Streit Lenstar, Oculus Pentacam.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"269\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<h1>OPERATIVE PLANNING MODULES – VERION – ONLY CENTRE IN PUNE HAVING THIS ADVANCED MACHINE (PUT PHOTOGRAPHS) –</h1>\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hvdeh.org/images/cataract/Cataract6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nPre-operative photograph and data of the eye to be operated is measured and surgical procedure planned by the vision planner module.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\r\nIt is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underwe','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-10 11:30:28','2019-06-10 11:30:28','',74,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/06/10/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(421,1,'2019-06-10 11:40:09','2019-06-10 11:40:09','<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception in the year 2000, PBMA’s&nbsp;H.V.

Desai Eye Hospital specialises in dealing with all types of glaucoma, including primary, secondary, paediatric and end-stage glaucoma. At present, glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness. As compared to cataract, it causes irreversible vision loss. Hence, our main purpose is to preserve vision and avoid the progression of blindness. We are equipped with all the latest modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma that is available in most modern healthcare centres.\r\n\r\n<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong>\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye in which pressure within the eye, i.e. intraocular pressure, increases. If left untreated, it is likely to result in permanent damage to the optic nerve that transmits images to the brain, which results in complete and irreversible blindness. In most cases, the cause of intraocular pressure cannot be ascertained, however, in some cases, it has been found to be caused by either trauma or the usage of certain medications.','Glaucoma','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur\r\nadipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt\r\nut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.

V. Desai Eye Hospital. In addition to patient care, the contact lens service at Wills Eye meets its goal to educate eye practitioners by sponsoring educational meetings that attracts participants nationwide.\r\n<h2>Contact Lenses for Children</h2>\r\nContact lenses for infants or young people are very useful when eyeglasses are inconvenient or will not provide the best results. In addition, contact lenses provide an optical correction that more closely approximates the normal eye. This is important in order to give your child the best chance to develop good vision.  Many parents are apprehensive about contact lenses for their children. Yet, with proper care and attention, the risk of complication is low and the potential benefit is high. It is our hope to make you comfortable with caring for your child\'s contact lenses so that problems can be avoided.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Dispensing Visit (for Children)</h2>\r\nWhen the contact lens is dispensed, the parent is taught how to insert and remove it, as well as how to care for the lens when not in the child\'s eye.  Patients wearing extended wear lenses must return in 24 to 48 hours. Patients wearing daily wear lenses should return within one to two weeks.\r\n<h2>Contact Lens Follow-up Visits (for Children)</h2>\r\nFollow-up visits are necessary to ensure that the lenses are fitted properly, vision is acceptable, and no adverse reactions have occurred. More frequent visits could be necessary for complex cases.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS MYOPIA (NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nMyopia, also known as near-sightedness, is a common type of refractive error where close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Myopia often progresses throughout the teenage years when the body (including the eye) is growing rapidly.  People with myopia have a higher risk of detached retina and glaucoma.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing distant objects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nMyopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanisms of the eye is “in front” of the retina.  This often occurs if an eye is longer than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA major risk factor for myopia is a family history of myopia.  Some genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, have a high association with myopia.  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also a risk factor for development of myopia later in life.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nMyopia is diagnosed by a careful refraction by an eye care professional.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nMyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery can also be used to correct myopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS)?</h1>\r\nHyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a refractive error that results from a disorder rather than from a disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image. Hyperopia usually is inherited and children who are hyperopic often become less hyperopic as adults.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n 	<li>Crossing of the eyes in children (esotropia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have hyperopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nHyperopia occurs when the image formed by the focusing mechanism of the eye is “behind” the retina. This often occurs if an eye is shorter than average.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA family history of hyperopia\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nHyperopia can be diagnosed by a careful refraction by an ophthalmologist.  For children and young adults, a cycloplegic refraction may be necessary to diagnose the correct amount of hyperopia. The focusing mechanism of the eye can mask the full amount of hyperopia but, during a cycloplegic refraction, eye drops are given to paralyze this mechanism so the true amount of hyperopia can be measured and corrected if needed.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nHyperopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive surgery may be able to correct some forms of hyperopia.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS ASTIGMATISM?</h1>\r\nAstigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye, the cornea, has an irregular curvature. Astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye. Astigmatism often occurs with near-sightedness and farsightedness, conditions also resulting from refractive errors. Astigmatism is not a disease nor does it mean that you have \"bad eyes.\" It simply means that you have a variation or disturbance in the shape of your cornea.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Distortion or blurring of images at all distances</li>\r\n 	<li>Headache and fatigue</li>\r\n 	<li>Squinting and eye discomfort or irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have astigmatism. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nNormally, the cornea is smooth and equally curved in all directions and light entering the cornea is focused equally on all planes or in all directions. In astigmatism, the front surface of the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other. This abnormality may result in vision that is much like looking into a distorted, wavy mirror. The distortion results because of an inability of the eye to focus light rays to a single point. If the corneal surface has a high degree of variation in its curvature, light refraction may be impaired to the degree that corrective lenses are needed to help focus light rays better. At any time, only a small proportion of the rays are focused and the remainder are not, so that the image formed is always blurred. Usually, astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nA small amount of astigmatism is very common and the tendency to develop astigmatism is inherited.  A larger amount of astigmatism can be associated with diseases such as keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nThe amount of astigmatism in the eye can be measured in various ways. The auto refraction or the subjective refraction—based on the patient’s response—that are done at the beginning of an eye exam is one way to measure astigmatism. The amount of astigmatism caused by the cornea is measured in the clinic by a diagnostic instrument called a Keratometer.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nIf the degree of astigmatism is slight and there are no other problems of refraction, such as near-sightedness or farsightedness, corrective lenses may not be needed. If the degree of astigmatism is great enough to cause eye strain, headache, or distortion of vision, corrective lenses will be needed for clear and comfortable vision. The corrective lenses needed for astigmatism are called toric lenses and they have an additional power element called a cylinder. They have greater light-bending power in one axis than in others. Your ophthalmologist will perform precise tests during your exam to determine the ideal lens prescription. Refractive surgery also may be an option for correcting some forms of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase slowly. Regular eye care can help to insure that proper vision is maintained. You may have to adjust to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses if you do not wear them now. Other than that, astigmatism probably will not significantly affect your lifestyle.\r\n<h1>WHAT IS PRESBYOPIA?</h1>\r\nPresbyopia is the result of the normal aging of the lens inside your eye.  A refractive error, presbyopia results from a disorder than from disease. The condition commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. As a result, it is more difficult to read at close range. A normal aging process of the lens, presbyopia can also occur along with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Near objects appear blurred</li>\r\n 	<li>Difficulty seeing objects up close</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is caused by the natural aging of the crystalline lens inside the eye.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nA careful refraction by your eye care professional will reveal if you are experiencing the symptoms of presbyopia.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\n<h1>KERATOCONUS</h1>\r\n<h1>WHAT IS KERATOCONUS?</h1>\r\nKeratoconus, meaning \"cone-shaped,\" is a condition in which the cornea (the clear front window of the eye) progressively becomes steeper and thinner. This abnormal shape of the cornea can cause distortion of visual images.\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"list\">\r\n 	<li>Frequent changing of glasses or contact lens prescriptions with high levels of astigmatism</li>\r\n 	<li>Blurring and distortion of vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Glare</li>\r\n 	<li>Light sensitivity and irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have keratoconus. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your ophthalmologist for a complete exam.\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\nThe cause of keratoconus is unknown. It usually appears in individuals during their late teens or early twenties. The disease usually progresses for 10 to 20 years as the cornea steepens and thins. Although both eyes may be affected, one eye is usually worse than the other.\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\nGenetics may contribute to your risk of developing keratoconus.  Vigorous eye rubbing is thought to add to development and progression of the disease; therefore patients with keratoconus are advised to avoid rubbing their eyes.\r\n<h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>\r\nSigns of keratoconus can be seen during a routine eye examination. These may include high degrees of astigmatism when checking a glasses prescription, or changes in the cornea as seen through the slit lamp microscope during an examination.  The diagnosis is often confirmed using corneal topography, photographs that measure the curvature of the cornea and highlight irregularities consistent with keratoconus.\r\n<h2>Treatment and Drugs</h2>\r\nAlthough there are no medicines known that will prevent progression of the disease, mild cases of keratoconus can be successfully treated with glasses or specially designed contact lenses. A customizable oversized hard contact lens device called Prosthetic Rehabilitation of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) can also improve vision for many patients with keratoconus.  When vision is no longer satisfactory with glasses or contact lenses, a corneal transplant may be recommended. In addition, intra-corneal rings have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of keratoconus. These crescent-shaped plastic rings are surgically placed into the outer edges of the cornea.  Collagen cross-linking is a new treatment that strengthens the cornea and may slow the progression of keratoconus.  This treatment is currently being studied by the FDA and is not yet commercially available in the United States.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Contact Lens','Contact Lens specialists at PBMA’s H.

It is known to occur in 40% of premature babies.\r\n\r\nHence, all babies born before the 34nd week or weighing less than 1800 grams are screened for ROP. In addition, babies diagnosed to be at a high risk of developing ROP by a neonatologist are also screened. The first screening takes place within 30 days of birth.\r\n\r\nThe modalities for screening available at our hospital are two Wide Field Cameras that help screen small babies by taking photographs of the retina:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Retcam: a digital camera system that has been developed in the U.S.</li>\r\n 	<li>Neo 3netra: a digital camera developed in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case any abnormality is found during screening, the doctor decides the severity of the disease based on the pictures thus obtained. These digital photographs are then shown to the parents of the child to help them understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThe most common treatment for ROP is laser therapy for which anaesthetic drops are administered. In very advanced cases, other options, such as intravitreal avastin therapy or vitrectomy surgery, are recommended. The child needs to undergo retinal screening upto the age of three.\r\n\r\nOur hospital is the fourth centre in India, and the only one in Maharashtra, to have a dedicated ROP service. Hence, it caters to the population of the entire state. Moreover, it is one of the few hospitals in India that provides surgery for advanced cases.\r\n\r\nWe run this program by extending services to various prime hospitals across Pune that offer the NICU facility. Screening and laser treatment is provided during these visits. In addition, patients admitted into Sassoon Hospital and Aundh Civil hospital are covered free of charge. Doctors from civil hospitals in five districts of Maharashtra, viz. Thane, Nashik, Usmanabad, Nagpur and Pune, are provided training at HVD in collaboration with the government of India.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have screened more than 10,000 babies, of which more than 1,000 babies have undergone laser therapy and enjoy good vision today. Intravitreal avastin therapy has been performed in 100 babies. In cases with very advanced ROP, which is potentially blinding, we have carried out vitrectomy surgeries in 85 babies and helped prevent blindness.','Retina','It is a disease that occurs in prematurely born, underweight babies due to the immaturity of the developing retina.','inherit','closed','closed','','74-revision-v1','','','2019-06-11 12:09:20','2019-06-11 12:09:20','',74,'http://local.hvd.com/2019/06/11/74-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(441,1,'2019-06-11 12:16:35','2019-06-11 12:16:35','<div class=\"breadcrumbs mb-4 clear-both\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a> / Our Facilities / Specialities /<strong> Ped.

As certain serious eye disorders produce no early warning symptoms, it becomes all the more necessary to know when to get your child evaluated by a qualified professional.\r\n\r\nThe paediatric ophthalmology services offered at H. V. Desai Eye Hospital are dedicated to provide comprehensive ophthalmic care to children aged below 16 years. The provision of these services is aimed at ensuring that no child is becomes blind, and to provide equal rights to children suffering from low vision as well as increased accessibility to all the possible medical services to enable them to play an active role in society. The paediatric ophthalmology services offered at the hospital provide treatment for all types vision-related problems in children, some of which are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n 	<li>Amblyopia (Lazy eye)</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric cataract</li>\r\n 	<li>Paediatric squint</li>\r\n 	<li>Nystagmus</li>\r\n 	<li>Low vision</li>\r\n 	<li>Ocular trauma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the paediatric ophthalmology department, in collaboration with the retina department, takes an active part in screening and visually rehabilitating kids suffering from Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).\r\n\r\nWith the glaucoma and oculoplasty department, common childhood problems such as paediatric glaucoma and oculoplasty disorders (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, ptosis, entropion, blepharophimosis, etc.) are also treated here. In addition, the strabismology services offered by this department provide treatment to adult patients suffering from double vision and squint.\r\n\r\nThis department examines and treats around 10,000 patients each year, which include the surgical treatment of around 2,500 children per year.\r\n\r\nThis department is also actively involved in school screening in the Pune and Satara districts to help in the earliest possible detection of ophthalmic conditions among children. This community outreach program helps paediatric patients to receive the best possible ophthalmic care at the earliest.','Ped.
